and i presented last month both on macs for react native for ios/android/windwos","i would say it characterizes push versus pull semantics, yes, interactive versus reactive","doesn't to me, as their

message","no, but there is a bit. wish i had numbers. would with enterprisejs know?","we're basically giving devs a choice instead of forcing them down one path hence our work on cordova, react native, etc","needs more system.reactive.linq...","in rn for uwp yes, it's a bridge to the native rn promise.","good luck with that. we have our own shitshow coming in november where nobody will win...","as long as we can use shtml, i'm sold!","wsl requires the latest and greatest windows insider builds. not sure if vms have that. any ideas?","yep we have those for msdn. we devs usually don't

using batteries included back in 2012 for rxjs","this is a microsoft sanctioned project and we're working closely with facebook on it","funny enough my team has three rx/reactor team members, me,

reminds me how much i admire you and all you've accomplished. happy mother's day!","that's straight from the redux docs","also, i don't like using js common methods like .bind which override the function#bind. bindsocket perhaps?","why are you swallowing errors in the observer? shouldn't you rethrow or at least let the client know of a failure?","we also support , and / react native (my work), so lots of options...","so that means we can now deploy apps to the windows store using , and now all using your js skills!","happy happy birthday! welcome to the 30s club, they'll be your best
