it's the latest version on npm :)","inferno 1.0 will have \"controlled components\" like react, fixing lots of issues with form input/select handling at the cost of 1kb gzip!","totally agree. inferno 1.0 will have much better compatibility with react and better perf/bundle size too :)","thanks for setting up this poll. would be good to also know who's played around with both inferno and preact.","let me know if you have any specific questions regarding inferno. i'll be happy to help","then later on, i became tired of using stateful components everywhere when i only wanted some lifecycle events.","there's a huge effort going on to iron out all incompatibilities with react via \"inferno-compat\" in the upcoming inferno 1.0.","what browser/version?","skip the dom, look for webgl and handle your own layers imo.","funny thing is, almost the same code 6 months ago was 15-20% different on v8. headache!","a) would mean a 40% cut in code from core from b) and a big simplification in how inferno works under the hood, at a cost of perf","true, this was more of a quick experiment. a) is very much like how react works b) is how inferno 1.0.0 currently works.","i agree, preact is is great! i hope in the future we can collaborate more with both are projects given the overlap","i do believe their are third-party stream renderers for react out there that do the same now.","regex101 all the way. great tool.","to use beta5 via npm, npm install inferno@beta5, same for all other core packages (inferno-xxx@beta5)","you can use inferno 1.0-beta5 now, it's the \"dev\" branch on github. going forward, \"inferno-mobx\" is the correct package to use.","glad you're liking the lifecycle hooks! i've had people tell me that they've built entire apps using only stateless components.","stick with inferno and you'll be alright :) it's fast and super small like preact plus has many other advantages","pre 1.0 was all in plain js, but with 1.0 we converted the codebase to ts. minus a few niggles it's been a good experience :)","the best bit? it's non jit performance on ios is about 3-4x faster than any other ui library out there.","it has a slightly lower parse time than, say, preact. however, it destroys vue, ng, react, polymer, preact in perf","that's the primary reason i created inferno. it goes runs great on legacy mobile devices, no qs asked","it is a curious point. a sort-of related bit, my friend recently went out for 18 months to help build an african school 1/2","it is and i'm saying that there's more to it than simply the size of a library's gzip size and how quick it takes to parse :)","what i mean is, i've intentionally added more code to inferno for performance benefits. it's slower to parse but insanely fast","then if it plain aborts downloading the \"font\" then i can't see websites digging that. big brands love their font","if the font hasn't loaded, the text on mobile sites appears blank to me. isn't that bad for interactivity?","mobile sites would be better off optimizing their custom fonts, pngs and svgs that weigh in 5-10x that.","doesn't this work in react too? i thought it would have done","imo a \"render\" should be a pure function and return only vdom. it ensures that preact has control over the flow still","is that show still running? i was always disappointed at the lack of superman/smallville references","epic fail. my 5tb hdd got killed in a power cut and won't spin. shame too, it contained the source code for angular 3 and react high-fiber.","fiber makes a lot of sense in react native. in the case of inferno, having sync updates on the dom should have better perf","i'm not entirely sure inferno needs to go down the route of react fiber, especially if inferno is only going to target the dom.","if you were to trade off library file size for performance, how much would you sacrifice? i'm not talking insane trade-offs, but small ones","i've heard today that inferno is \"massively bloated\". inferno weighs in 9kb gzip for a react setup. preact is 6kb gzip. they're both tiny!","i don't too many people still know about inferno, especially in the uk. i find a lot of js devs know of preact","as we ideally want a way of exporting styles for a generic ui library (we use react) as we have teams use angular, .net, etc.","ah we don't have these issues at tesco. i'll run your latest project by the team next week too. looks good! can you export to css?","if i said 'let's rewrite our app in elm' they'd be cool with it. if i suggested using aphrodite, there'd literally be a fist fight","i find css is set in stone for some people/teams. took about 5 years before they would even use sass, let alone more recent ones","wasn't jsx a copy of e4x + few tweaks? they look almost identical.","...every website has its own requirements and user behaviours that need addressing. that's why we have jobs :)","it loads amazingly fast for legacy browsers there's no js. do also remember, this is tesco, not twitter...","modern browsers have faster engines and support for more than 2 connections at a time + 1000s more reasons.","meaning we don't have to spend time polyfilling and spending time making things work for people who don't use modern browsers","actually ssr is awesome. at tesco we ssr render all pages, perfect for legacy browsers as we force js to be disabled on ie8-10","i found that wrapping a single child in an array had a negative impact on perf with inferno","so when i say bsd (in my original tweet) i mean the same bsd license that yarn has, not the current license that react has.","this react license issue regarding patents keeps coming up. i do wonder, given yarn is bsd, couldn't react be bsd too?","well, inferno and preact work with existing react codebases with very little friction riot is a complete departure.","hey, i bumped into you a while back at finjs (i was with the guys from caplin at the time). how are things going?","you should totally give inferno a try if you want mobx + a faster react. if you run into any issues you can ping me!","i found when bundling inferno that sometimes having more code resulted in smaller gzip bundles","but this is a comparison of gzip code? gripped code isn't parsed, the uncompressed code is?","@hummlas there may be a future where can work together more. regardless, this is good competition for react","@hummlas inferno has better performance, stateless component lifecycle events and components returning arrays","@hummlas preact features linked state and smaller bundle sizes (9kb vs 6kb roughly).","i completely agree that const is better if used right. i've seen less errors when devs adopt it properly","completely agree here. thankfully both preact and inferno excel in this area imo","i'm just wrapping up \"inferno-motion\" at the moment (a port of react motion). i'll send you some stuff over once i'm done :)","i can point you to some small examples, or were you looking for large ones? i assume you want hyperscript over jsx too?","devtools will be coming soon to inferno 1.0 all rendered with inferno too :) same for the custom events (future tho)","inferno support would be awesome as i'm building an app that could totally use this :)","i'm struggling creating a chrome dev tools extension. i'm trying to make my library \"talk\" to my dev tools tab via postmessage. any help?","i remember your immutable objects proposal for tc39. is there any developments on that? i can see so much value in this still","no convincing needed. i just did the roll the dice benchmark and got 6 - so it would appear angular1 wins!","someone else recommended that earlier. unfortunately, you can't use custom babel plugins with it :(","unfortunately, inferno doesn't work with react jsx pragmas. it's a completely optimised output compilation.","for context: i want to enable \"babel-plugin-inferno\", a jsx plugin for inferno. is this possible?","does anyone know of a jsfiddle/codpen like online code editor service that allows you to use custom babel plugins? not having much luck!","inferno is now in a happy state and people are using it so the internals will be locked down for 1.0; just like react has been","the apis are the same, it's more the engine under the hood. lots of profiling, benchmarking, looking out for deopts. it's tricky","i mean we all know how costly recruiters are. having people apply to paypal directly saves costs and can be far more effective.","if you get a chance, it would be awesome if you could check out inferno. it's very much like the awesome preact. :)","good work on the latest preact. someone came up to me today and asked me about it! :)","i've just realised that i made a typo and wrote \"of the of\". this is also in regards to a javascript library. not the movie!","what was the third-party library?","i think this is a true in my eyes. imo the vdom concept has massive potential; more discussion needs to happen","people will chuck my library into a site with an existing theme. the chances of them specifying div display is likely","i can easily determine if a browser has this new node and fallback to another js impl if not.","as a library author, my components should be able to work without having userland styling getting in the way or browser diffs","... but better. as the docfrag loses its children once appended. this would play with with abstract components in react etc","awesome :) if you want to ask any questions, feel free to dm me and i'll be happy to help how i can","it's great to see such great collaboration. snabbdom is a great library. although should i still bother with an inferno driver?","thank you :) much appreciated!","you should give it a try. it's fully compatible with react using \"inferno-compat\" module. :)","is anyone interested in building the website/docs site for inferno? any help would be appreciated! also, any rts would be much appreciated!","unlike a documentfragment, it wouldn't lose its children once appended to another element. its children would remain attached.","i'll be honest: i'm really surprised it took you guys this look to adopt this approach. the performance difference is gigantic!","if you could follow me, i'd happily dm you/talk to you about it. in fact, it would be a pleasure to if you have the time.","i just want to say a massive thank you to everyone who's been involved in inferno's development. i really couldn't have done it without you.","if you have any questions regarding inferno, let me know :) it does a few additional things that react doesn't do just yet","you don't happen to have come across this?","is there a way to pass config to a babel plugin? i want to be able to tell babel-plugin-inferno to output inline objects or not","for the upcoming inferno 1.0. should hyperscript be available in core as standard?","hey, it would be good if you could check out inferno if you do another js library/framework comparison on the auth0 blog!","i can, i just hoped ts would output better code when exported as a const - even though i've stated es6 compile output.","if you have a chance/time. would it be possible to?

inferno was written for performance demanding apps and this the area it excels at.","yep, he did have some issues with hot reloaded, so we had to disable that (it's on the roadmap, i'll have to build my own).","another person said he saw his dashboard animations go up by almost 10 fps with no changes, just using react-motion. insane :)","they tested it on their existing react codebases. medium size 50k+ loc. one person said he had 8x faster startup times on android!","i've had some people trial the latest alpha of inferno 1.0 + the new jsx inferno optimiser. feedback has been extremely positive overall!","yes. textnodes that have been appended to the same parent via appendchild. it works fine.","it wasn't too bad but performance wasn't quite there compared to html in body. 2/2","it would be nice not to have to. i was experimenting with precompiled js in body vs html. 1/2","i went that route to begin with. people using hyperscript rather than jsx found it too cumbersome to have to write every time.","i don't see this happening. i have references to separate textnodes in ie9 and its working?","ah yes but ssr is handled by comments to split textnodes. i thought react did the same?","they are used, only when mounting though. docfrags are useless after being appended.","i've not seen any merging of appended textnodes during inferno's acceptance tests?","on a side note, this is something that react and preact should totally support too","was that how the \"use strong\" proposal (i know it's been scrapped) was going to operate? like wasm?","you can, but it's more that if they were removed, the js engine can make better assumptions and remove quite a bit of overhead.","i do kind of wish there was a stricter \"use strict\" in javascript. i'd love to remove the \"arguments\" and \"delete\" keywords completely.","can i make a dev tools suggestion: i love how the ms gets shown in source view when profiled. can it also show deopt info too?","it seems that maquettejs is simply not rendering anything correctly! well that would explain the performance being so good :)","check the babel handbook. also look through the core module code of other modules like jsx etc. that's how i did it","which react europe was it?

i don't see it as one. is that where the problem lies?","what makes you think that? i've been having these issues with the js ecosystem since way before react existed.","on the flip-side vscode is vastly faster with ts. the difference is literally huge atom would constantly lock-up for seconds.. :(","i don't quite understand why'd you want to do this. functional components have their own benefits over purecomponents.","played around with flow a bit more last night. enjoying flow, but didn't find the atom + nuclide dx to be as slick as vscode + ts :(","awesome stuff guys! now all you need to do is switch react out for inferno :p","can't jest play nicely with karma?

lately chrome has regressed on class performance, but around three versions ago classes were faster!","goals for inferno 0.8: 10-30% faster, components will return arrays, barebones api for adoption in other libraries and fully typescript 2.0.","browser adoption for most prevents use of such features. i have no choice but to use \"then\"","i met with two weeks ago when he was in london. i remember a very different discussion regarding promises..","vscode + typescript had been far smoother than atom + nuclide for me on large projects","ah, you're assigning it within the context of a component. how would you go about getting the dom node without a component?","ref callback for unmounting returns null for the dom node reference. whilst ondeteched would return the dom node reference.","i need to get the inferno website made so this all clearer. :) it's on my todo list!","let me add an extra level of components to the inferno version for you.","a component is not a blueprint. a blueprint is like a reactelement factory that hoists out static info.","also, most people opt to use functional components in inferno, they are about 2x faster than es2015 comps","what performance do you get when you remove the extra two components in the react version?","the babel-plugin-inferno plugin takes jsx and makes blueprints from them.","i have to use the latest chrome on s7 though, using the samsung browser i get barely 3 fps on both","that's why there's \"inferno-compat\". there's a few issues atm. aim is to be react compatible at least","you can just use aliases to alias packages out for other ones. look at 'preact-compat' and 'inferno-compat' packages :)","needs to be at bundler level. as you don't usually run babel on node_modules and other deps","preact is solid work! in fact, i'd even recommend using preact or inferno as swap-ins for react for dom apps","make sure you try preact too - the other react-like library","i spend so many hours in irhydra2 - i love it. i was trying to show some react deopts last friday when we met up in fact","notably:preact-compat ideas for inferno-compat and preact-router for inferno-router","that's okay. i'll credit preact on some of the things i've taken in inferno too!","great to hear someone else is a fan of catering for older devices too. the developer community can sometimes be blind to this.","it gets complicated, excluding \"node_modules\" from babel compilation is common. so it can't change those requires","there will soon be an \"inferno-compat\" module that does this via alias replacement in weback/browserify. :)","inferno can be 1:1 compatible with all existing react libs/code using a compatibility layer. except it's 5x faster","thanks for your thoughts. i plan to port and help react where possible with the lessons learnt from inferno. :)","it's the library i've been working on the for the last 18 months. any feedback would be awesome :)","just looked at the code. why are you popping rather than shifting? why aren't you tracking by id?","2/2 it's sometimes hard to appreciate thing x, given new thing y. thing x may have brought much needed progression.","i hope that isn't the case. it would be pointless and give developers no real benefit at all. it all needs some proper thought.","i've not seen componentkit before, is it also a facebook product?","i thought async image decoding was already under development? i agree completely with these though, html5 video would be nice 2","i agree in regards to threads, although the async-append proposal makes a lot of sense to me, especially on slow devices.","i'm having the exact same problem. i wonder if the api is ready yet?","this is what t7 has been going and people never minded too much. although you have to be careful with how you link the components","the scripts were append to the page via script tags. although i can't seem to then debug the source of the file once it's loaded","...i assume this feature is coming in ios 10? it's a shame you can't install an ios safari tech preview independently of ios version","i've tried safari tech preview whilst remote debugging an ios 9 device and i still can't properly inspect async scripts","nor can webkit, sucks everytime :(","you should totally do inferno before angular :) let me know if you need some help","i'll try and dig up the tools we used, although this is 3-4 years ago","years ago when i was building target's new website, we used tools to scan css/images etc to give back a11y reports on contrast","github pages is fine with me. i plan on using the inferno monorepo for the website too (similar to how react does).","i hope to, at some point, work closely with the react team and port the concepts over to react-core if they're happy for them","but ultimately, inferno was built for pure performance with a much smaller code-base. all the code was optimised using irhydra2","it also offers \"hooks\" directly on elements and stateless components, which is a nice addition","it's actually a very different implementation, but has a similar api and surface to allow for easy switching of react -> inferno","sounds like a plan. :) i just tried to signup to the meetup now. it appears to be full though :(","any chance of a retweet for inferno? i'm eager to speak at the next react conference too. give a date+time and i'll talk performance","not currently, but could be fairly simply to make happen. :)","blueprints were an optimisation technique, they'll be removed in 0.8 and replaced with a much better \"template\" method.","orientated. i'd much prefer more react content on day 2. i enjoyed the overall experience in general, minus the coffee+beer :) 2/2","i felt that day 2 was far too \"graphql\" orientated, which is great for those who have such use, but it wasn't really \"react\"... 1/2","i opted for typescript in a similar situation: it had better docs, better third-party type support and a huge community.","without a form of dsl or static typing, it's hard to predict whether data/state should be skipped for components. i've been...","are you at reacteurope?","thanks for the feedback :) i'd love to somehow get inferno's perf back into react. would benefit everyone. keep up the good work :)","its a widely known problem with cordova submitted apps. a quick google and you'll see the same scenario","tell me about it. we re-submitted the same app with a version change 3 weeks later and it was approved lol","we were not building an app where we needed to use camera/notifications etc. it was a shopping app. 2/2","my company were rejected many times over issues to do with \"not using enough native ios features\" 1/2","they are extremely tight with cordova based apps! depends on the reviewer and their mood. it's not a positive exp","the lottery of apple approving the app has been an issue in my experience. i wouldn't rely on it as a solution","if we had a best-tool-for-all-jobs we'd all essentially make ourselves unemployed.","the big topic around atm is redux vs mobx. it's a silly argument, they both have valid use-cases that make them the \"best tool for the job\".","no problem mate :) great redux videos btw i've let my work colleagues know about them. keep up the good work :)","i've been using vs code for the last few days now and i'm really impressed with it. much faster than atom and feels as stable as sublime.","yet, using settimeout of 100ms fixed both platforms, with a slight loss on desktop, but far better cpu usage and better android","it was almost like requestidlecallback was throttling potentially long updates. was massively evident on slower android devices","looking into using flow or typescript for inferno's codebase. any recommendations?","sorry, i don't. i changed it as i was to it should of 50 (100 technically) instead","it has other cool \"features\" too, but i'd love your feedback. especially as it handle static content via the babel plugin :)","would you mind having a look, it's a react-like library with a strong emphasis on performance specifically to deal with mobile.","just realised that inferno's \"lazy\" deferred elements are pretty much the same thing as 's incremental reconciler for react.","would you like to talk on the inferno slack about the technical implementation details? i can send you an invite if you want :)","imo, that would be a very good idea. i'd hate to think developers were trying to avoid 'strict' today.","i saw your pr for snabbdom (it's a great library). have you had a chance to check out inferno lately? good to have your feedback :)","nothing brilliant is happening in this space because it's such an opinionated space to begin with.. designers..","it's definitely something that needs to happen though!","people use inferno with pure functions and its hooks functionality, which is something i expect react to copy!","well, inferno only strives to keep up with the react es2015 component model - because that's the \"good bits\".","is it just me, or is everyone getting accustomed to having a 2-3 minute npm install times on large projects?","good news: inferno 0.7 (to be released soon) has full optimisation support for non jsx users without needing a complier step!","couldn't agree more. i feel like missed the boat with what this library is aiming to do. everything has pros and cons.","we're working on an update on inferno - we hope to get the core library size down to about 10kb minified. :)","javascript fatigue was going to be the 2016 topic of choice i think. considering the amount of uptake javascript had in 2015.","a mixture of chrome dev tools (profiling+timeline) and ir hydra 2 to see where the deopts were. worth it in the end :)","performance on mobile was a huge factor in deciding to build inferno - especially older android devices","the angular-table-test was a fork from someone on the angular team that i worked from. thanks for pr","ah, great to hear! inferno is still in development but is definitely getting there (people are starting to use it in prod).","finally got my twitter account re-activated after many years - thanks ! now it's time to get back to developing inferno :)","is loving linode's management tool.","working on some tasty nando's web designs!","is looking at getting a macbook pro and upgrading its crappy hdd to a ssd. hmm..","is looking at buying a cheap mac mini now that he is an iphone developer. may get ihacker, developster and ustudy put on the iphone.","is playing games + watching movies + programming ihacker","developing ihacker"]
