i feel the opposite, but maybe i'm romanticizing because i spend more time writing js","that said, the way we communicate the learning, i.e. watercolor/oil || js/python does shape it a bit.","edit: learning js first for a cs degree","there are probably more good real-life reasons for learning js than my admittedly academic background accounted for","thank you! much appreciated","in your opinion, what are the best resources for people trying to learn pwas? much appreciated.","also then people who learn js are immediately employable x10","but the really good counter-points people brought up: you can start using it immediately on the web, and the dopamine rush attached","and that it might be better to learn more than one language (that they would then learn js after)","i guess i didn't clearly frame my tweet- as a js dev, i do understand how important it is, i was suggesting python is v teachable","yep, all good points. i guess i was thinking they'd learn js too, but after. but yeah having an initial dopamine rush is important","agreed, but i usually people who think that way don't acknowledge js as a real lang either","the decision by stanford to use javascript to teach instead of java has me wondering, why not python?","nice! though most of my course is javascript-based.","aw the look of happiness on the kids face...","np! my react europe will have a bunch of oss examples too. i'll post the demos after :)","like, i cover css in my book because people use it. but i drill down a comparison and then teach a number of js libraries","eh, css isn't the best tool for great animations. simple animations, sure. anything beyond that, js is more powerful.","cutest programming tweet ever","yeah! i do animations with react now but i think it will be much better","good to start with 's react conf talk. she masterfully explained everything you need to know :)","just sittin here daydreamin about fiber like anyone who animates in react does","haha i code drunk more often than i care to admit","hi, i'm not sure i remember or know- i'm sorry- do you have any other keywords?

i do for sure. when i train junior devs they're really excited about it","for us now, but as a beginner dev that was invaluable. i needed to see how things worked","just regular strokes. this has happened before too, it's not totally clear to me when they decide to do this. maybe for scaled values","dawww, the best of the internet. tech nerdery and puppies","right, canvas has its own use case. though paired with react there are more opportunities for accessibility","i'd take out one of those verys, but yeah it's not as easy as apple's built ins for sure","for these reasons mobile web is super tricky, so i would say you're both right :)","i'm under the gun on contracts right now, but if you're interested in a month or so, i'd be happy to help mentor","yeah you have a great voice. puppy approved!","i have a new article coming out thursday so the tech will eventually continue","she's already got me wrapped around her paw","she's sooo cuddly. it's hard to take a picture of her because she keeps just wanting to cuddle. we're happy doggie parents.","rewatching harry potter with . we can't believe how amazing the props and sets are- i didn't fully appreciate this before","on codepen, individual demos are called 'pens'","yep, the backstory is that vue was created by evan who was using angular at the time and wanted to improve on it","svg is built for drawing in a way that html and css are not. if i wanted to refactor to create shapes that bind to data, simple.","also, not exactly zines, but makes the dopest code cartoons","i use webpack every single day. you do provide a service.","post-workshop days: so happy, so exhausted. i earned my sleep","no! not you, sorry- i meant angular jobs. man, this reply feature is a bug not a feature.","ah- i haven't found that to be the case, interesting. i see almost no smil demos, all js some css. you should check codepen. :)","oh yay! that makes me so happy to hear!","what is this app?","ugh that's awful. sorry that happened to you.","as well as css animation, raf, comparison of libraries, greensock, mo.js, react-motion, and some data vis. i tried to cover a lot of uses","that's the part that really annoys me. i was up there saying \"i made this to show...\", show the demo, then show the code.","check out the power of scoped styles & slots together, too. it's like css modules in react but more horsepower","i showed the demos and then the code behind them. actually having to clarify this further is fucked too","ugh the worst. i'm sorry that happened to you.","i work with both but i especially love vue. you can still use redux with vue! but i recommend vuex (which is vue's version)","hey thanks! that's so appreciated :)","coding isn't \"native to men\" though in a way that a language is native to a geography and people.but i get what you're saying","or in programming terms, when someone says \"works on my machine\"","oh yeah, it's awesome. so powerful and elegant. easy to maintain because the code is clean, too.","after my talk: guy: so who coded your demos? me: i did g: so you used a gui? m: no i coded it g: you code? m: yes g: no, like actual code","yes! i tried to make it understandable from beginning to end. i go very slowly through javascript animations especially.","you use css and js to manipulate svg","aw, thank you much appreciated, and very well-timed :)","haha teachers say the darnedest things. those are the technical terms.","yeah actually! maybe i should write a post... javascript for kids + codepen has worked for us :)","haha, well technically, that's true too","sounds like you may need to upgrade node, rm -rf node_modules, and npm install again","figuring out a drone dev project w/ . because then we can get a drone and write it off. tax-exemption-driven-development","aw thanks jason!! much appreciated","i'm starting to wonder if we got rid of a/b testing if websites would become usable again","both- we talk about css, some data vis, greensock, mo.js, raf, react-motion, and i give a comparison of other ways to animate too","i'll be there in may and september!","we're working on case sensitivity- it's hard because she's learning to type at the same time. computers can't infer an approximation","tonight i was teaching my 8yo stepdaughter to code & taught her how to write functions using svg & clonenode. it's actually a good example!","thank you! you've put me in some good company there :) appreciated","i think people argue about javascript on here sometimes","yes absolutely! i'm at next week and also sfhtml5","thank you! i'm so happy","i'd love a crack at improving gmail's ux. maybe a good excuse for a codepen project.","yeah, i can too. i think that's not much better than where i'm at right now, but thank you, i appreciate it.","really? i never found that to be true- maybe has some suggestions- i think they're building stuff for ipad.","it's all developer ergonomics to me- i don't care how ppl write it as long as it's maintainable (tl;dr of my post)","are there css purists?
