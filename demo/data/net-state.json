did some testing and its generally smaller","react-like virtual dom libraries","react lite there are a ton of vdom libs but generally not aimed at being compatible more similar","do you assign to a

use preactaliases seen it done somewhere","its crazy i hadnt though of that as a use-case when i originally created preact but it makes so much sense","that makes me happy","recommendation is still basically dont rely on it in app code more or less","in the works we use a combo of preact-jsx-chai preact-test-utils normal rendering into undomjsdom etc","i like that approach local until some specific need to be shared","im pushing for context to just be automatically passed down preact does this and its working very well","were using component state for most stuff but need a few things shared like user preferences etc","nomisweb super interested to hear your experiences share away","understandable though since preact has the same api as react its not really another framework in

model its likely smaller than any template engine anyway","oh for ssr there isnt a ton of difference you can think of preact-render-to-string as a sort of template engine tbh","using a template engine really means using innerhtml which means blowing away the dom and rebuilding it for every update","want to open an issue on the preact repo happy to discuss there and prioritize a fix","very much appreciated","yup and moreso for lists of components for dom changes its often best to addremove the last items","most im aware of are slapping graphql in front of rest seems a nice fit","in that

just thinking innerhtml is the pain there maybe a setter that walks the tree","the markdown part is silly i admit but controlling vdom from html is pretty useful","coolest feature of preact-markup is that you can register any component as a custom element basically ce for vdom","i use it to render preact components - just run the output through new domparserparsefromstringxtexthtml","though tbh

nightmare","hmm - not when you have 30 repos that depend on a ui toolkit that is evolving on its own","i guess my hope would be that it would test composition for components that do composition","a function call yes but it also has to annotate all the jsx elements so they correlate with the stylesheet","snapshots only really apply to best since they require filesystem access","im a little late to the party but we have tools for rendering to inert dom amp asserting over it will release them","i think its something like that but maybe only for jsx in the same scope since its done via babel","might be worth mentioning im experimenting with templates preact","or styled-jsx is simpler than im thinking which is good it only styles that component","just an experiment btw i generally stick to inline styles or css modules haha","its just components and inline stylesheets so yes point about runtime was that its not a build runtime","similar but no babel plugin and it supports mixing

versa","ive experimented a bit and where i usually end up is this is what components are for","arent those called components","virtual dom was used to explain what jsx was all about nobody should need

westworld happens","psssh the best developers i know make apps with zero errors","and yeah we also do stuff like print the component stack so you know where it originated","bubble the error up the component tree and allow you to catchhandle them like a try-catch block","no what we do is ensure that user errors never leave react in an inconsistent state like they do today and","the way react fiber handles errors is pretty neat do any other view librariesframeworks have a special way of handling with errors","a component with 100 children and a parent with 1 both represent 1 unit","ah yes thatll show them money-grubbers at apple","dont fret about this too much the real solution will be new apis in react that guard against accidental mistakes","technically no but since theres no better solution for now you can keep doing it","the original router was copied from ember right seems only fair that you give them one in return d","yes but for each use case well provide an alternative better way to do it","were going to fix this problem in a future release by replacing classes with a functional api","for the purposes of this discussion setstate on self is not considered a side-effect setstate on another component is","aside from perf implications in dev mode not all prop functions have side-effects","you can use them to set instance variables just shouldnt mutate anything outside the component itself","re componentwillreceiveprops performing side-effects in there isnt much better than doing them in the render method avoid","you can call thissetstate in cwrp but you shouldnt trigger updates on other components","you can set up state for the component itself not other components though","its not thats actually the only thing that you should do in cwrp just dont call it on another component","if you think about it putting effects in componentwillreceiveprops isnt much better than putting it in render","im mostly curious if this is something people even think about when writing their components","all are correct except cwrp you can setstate on the component itself not a parentsibling but should avoid other effects","lets say anything besides thissetstate on the component itself","that way if the api changes you only have to migrate the until not every component that uses it","when you have 30000 components in production you dont change apis lightly d","fiber will keep the same api initially we want it to be as easy as possible for people to migrate","yep with a separate ltprovidergt for each thing on context future version might not support multiple contexts per component","by future self i alsoespecially mean the poor junior dev who will inherit your beautiful mess","thats what react does too hard to make it both performant and correct though given current api we err on the perf side","the keys of the context object establish an indirect link between components would be better if static","yall if youre using context in react do your future self a favor and use it via an abstraction hoc api will almost certainly change","tell me about it d current version has many flaws so im excited to change that not so excited to migrate facebooks codebase","though the context api will likely change too","yeah not sure what well do about that state arg since react currently uses it for context","though maybe for preact thats a plus not a minus","this is really cool heads up though react will have similar-but-different in the near future so might be compat issues","hocs are immutable the original component isnt changed and can continue to be used","i dont think the question is about functional vs class components","if i remember the books correctly they were filled with that sort of humor","a parent and child are re-rendered whose componentdidupdate is called first","if react always waited to check if there were multiple calls then it would ever be sync","in other words the only safe use of cwrp is to call thissetstate its not the best api unfortunately","the part thats confusing is that setstate on a parent or other component inside cwrp is not safe","the gist of it is nested updates create many problems were going to see if we can get away with removing them completely in react fiber","thats a problem that react fiber aims to solve but if that were the case in react-of-today then no updates would ever be sync","thats about the gist of it yeah there are other scenarios where this happens too","not quite but react fiber future react does prioritize different types of updates so i like how you think","all updates are queued question is why does react sometimes flush the queue immediately and other times wait until later","the first part is correct but there are other scenarios where react does the same thing","if react waited to see if setstate were called multiple times then setstate would never be sync","the escape hatch will likely be something like reactdomunstable_syncupdates gt thissetstatestate","if react waited to see if setstate were called multiple times then setstate would never be sync","react fiber does this but thats not why react-of-today defers some updates","important because in a future version of react all updates will be async by default well have an escape hatch to ease migration","react fiber does do some clever stuff with scheduling animations but the original question applies to current react too","only that it is sometimes and your code should not make assumptions either way","react trivia challenge sometimes setstate isnt applied synchronously but deferred until later as part of a batch do you know why","there a bunch of optimizations though hard to say what the actual big o is","updates on the component itself are inserted in order of priority worst case insertion is on common case is o1","so each component has a queue of updates but the entire tree is also a queue to find the first component to work on its a bfs","omg i was using --save-dev instead of --save works now","ounit or any unit testing library","js has its problems but npm install pkg -gt requirepkg sure is nice","tried using reason again gave up because i couldnt figure out how to install a library again","it was helpful for figuring out starvation like a todo app of scheduling d","if we ever introduce an explicit api for low pri updates perhaps not","true though i can still forsee bristling at higher-order functions being a central part of the api","love it works great in reason because you can assume familiarity with curryinghof wonder what js users will think","i skeptical anyone will care as long as its easier to type and their code still works for now","few people know about this api unfortunately example of pit-of-success failure need stateful functional component api","its clear in react-of-today in react-of-the-future it will be misleading","whats the use case to avoid having to wrap parts of subtree in another component and use scu","i wish shouldcomponentupdate were called something like areinputsequal i think thats a better description of its contract","i had no idea

programmer and im glad i did theres no one way to learn","we need eslint-plugin-optimization","or if you use unstable_batchedupdates but again best to write your code as if its always async","right now its only async if its called as the result of another update eg componentdidmountupdate","its not always async but you should write your code as if it is because one day it will be async by

dont do it by default is because it doesnt work on npm2","as mentioned in readme though the workaround is adding literally a single line to packagejson","i assumed they dont exist because even

about lifting state up setstate works fine with subtrees with many components","looks fine to me for rapid prototyping you can always break them apart later","its a known issue and wont be solved until react-scripts010","what is confusing you yes i think 052 is latest stable version its versioned separately from react-scripts","just make sure that your webserver doesnt serve cached html when it has changed and the rest should work out of the box","if source was different then hashes will be different in filenames so unless html is cached somehow it will bust caches","not sure honestly i

are retained tho","react just keeps objects around which have current props on them thats about it it doesnt recreate trees of them","theres no full vdom thats the problem this is a misunderstanding

provided by a library prefer to have control","again the point of react isnt being fast its diving ui in declarative components it only helps if browser is fast","so no applying dom changes is usually pretty fast although of course it can trigger layouts and paints","all of the above is reconciliation we call applying dom changes a commit and its done in a single pass in fiber","the more expensive part is calling react components recursively to learn which elements they render to and diffing child lists","what do you mean by vdom is updated in react all that happens is internalinstanceprops

single optimized bundle is faster","this makes sense for react because its not a utility package like lodash or bootstrap you cant use 50 of react","this lets us remove some browserifywebpack junk

get there when the ecosystem is ready right now it is a mess its a turbulent period and we stick with what works","third party components published to npm may use for example requirereactcreateclass how could the bundler safely delete it","in particular even if your bundler supports it it only works for libraries published as es6 modules react isnt","tree shaking is not something magic you should create a tiny library and see how it works for yourself too much misinformation","theres a myth making the rounds that importing less from react package makes bundle smaller no it doesnt","if you see saving its because jsx output is short","note react is not es module package","your webpack config is likely broken please try create react app and compare","cap_colors this is why you need a known good setup like cra instead of letting every engineer change webpack config","cap_colors seriously though tools are not bad but they are too easy to misconfigure","for what its worth it is exactly how fb and most large companies using react -","not sure what exactly youre asking but whats wrong with calling reactdomrender twice with different target dom nodes","no idea but i wouldnt try to think from redux point of view how would you do this in plain js","curious why this wouldnt help eg ufi note that the proposal doesnt behave like bootloadedcomponent","interesting code splitting at least crude always seemed easy to me but ssr seemed hard","we should try to figure out why it breaks but i still dont understand why install more tools before trying existing ones","noticed a problem with create react app people cant believe it works out of the box and try installing webpackbabel on top breaking it","this could be better if more libraries explained migration path and change motivations and more developers didnt treat alphas as stable","developer this api is flawed and doesnt let me do x y and z developer also you are an asshole for changing it","so were trying to move react itself away from that so that we have full control over how its bundled","its also not using webpack or anything like this theres a lot of custom infrastructure for bundling js","and not its fully synchronous nature complicated code splitting antimodular middleware etc these problems pale in comparison","my point wasnt to pick on your choice but on the idea of taking a random code screenshot and using it to make a super broad point","even preserving immutability there are solutions on different cpumemoryreadability spectrum just like with any other tool","if youre running 800 redux dispatches in a second maybe redux isnt the best tool -","also fb always relied on internals that werent exposed they still wont be public apis but well have to play fair with build process","super

time but it lets you use webpack hmr api if youre ok with it","npm start edit appjs in template to violate it","better build then maybe removing some code","its hard to optimize anything and also hard to change internals because ppl rely on private apis","we are slowed down very much by different build processes in oss rn and www","the plan is to push the whole proptypes library to userland and let community improve it","react uses long module names and they turn into long exported properties rollup inlines","no the overhead is just from all the crap at module boundaries in browserified bundle","you can also fork react-scripts","excited to pair with on making react smaller","i dont know what you mean but in this example all consuming components need reference to theme at init time","jumping through the hoops to make an api relying on identity thisless isnt solving anything better to make a new api","todays thanks go to and lerna-changelog that make pushing releases for multiple interdependent packages a breeze even on branch","haha no another one - if anything its the devtools code i didnt understand not pr itself","context is broken in current version but well solve it eventually for deep updates with a different api","i see then i guess webpack should expose blessed cache","you dont have a flash if the library can wait for you","anyway yea better to work on proof of concept in react -","the server rendered markup would stay until promise resolves without special app code","the end result would be that during this tick react waits for the promise

author i think its cute npm doesnt exist only for your serious packages","i dont think npm link will work what didnt work the first copy paste way","npm run build in react folder then copy buildnode_modules into your projects node_modules manually","unfortunately user timing api doesnt have support for prefixes so emoji is the best we can do to avoid taking precious space","if we always emit marksmeasures in dev we have to prefix them somehow for people who read measurements and dont care","as we learn more about which patterns work well and bad with fiber well likely add more perf tooling but this will take some time","it doesnt have the neat wasted calculation but it shows you exactly what is happening surfaces worse issues eg cascading updates","we probably wont ship reactperf in its existing form with fiber not clear how it would work with new constraints this is a replacement","just to double checkare you using yarn or npm id suggest nuking node_modules and reinstalling with the other","consolas babeloceanic next","i would still prefer that the package authors ship several precompiled versions and app picks closest available below","im concerned about increasing already slow build times for projects with lots of third party deps everyone pays the price","id still appreciate constructive suggestions on what cra can do better after youve finished judging my attitude","if we go back to the original tweet i see you implying that cra shouldnt depend on so many packages","yarn was created exactly because of these concerns and they inform its development i hope you contribute to it","youll find that theres no answer here thats scales and isnt arbitrary fix this in package managers and registry","should we limit features because of fear of extra packages how many is okay are they equally trustworthy","i dont think attitude discussions are helpful can you propose an alternative for what cra should do","create react app is not a library it is a package integrating oss build tools how are we positioned to solve this","attacking us over this makes just as little sense as attacking babel for example but thanks for your concern","if you want to solve the problem you should bring it up with npm eg yarn lockfiles are first step","im not saying its safe im saying it is exactly as safe as status quo in npm ecosystem for better or worse","create react app curates and packages what the community has already settled on in a cohesive way thats it","if this is a concern for you i presume you dont use tools like babel webpack jest etc many cant afford that","you can apply this argument to anything in npm ecosystem use lockfiles and audit updates in your dependencies","miracles happen when people are determined enough","the way github ranks project contributors is broken number of own commits is a bad metric for people guiding others and reviewing code","create react app has just switched to using prettier for formatting its own internal codebase","i picked it up with c alter used in python carrying it over to js was simple after that its a universal idea","it should be copied as readmemd into newly created projects by create react app youre welcome","in general if youre maintaining a library id recommend avoiding apis that rely on extending user-provided classes until this stabilizes","explanation a extends b doesnt currently work if a is written with browsers class syntax but b is written with babel class transform","no real reason nobody just bothered to do the jump we did with react","why in the vast majority of cases calculating in render with regular javascript is enough -","id only warn you that hand-rolled setups often miss crucial features like component stack traces or optimized builds","you can create react apps with a plain html file if you want to but most people prefer stable tools to automate tasks","last time i checked xcode libraries were bigger these are real tools like in any language","it contains a compiler a minifier a development server with hot reloading of css a test runner with fake dom etc","it would be better if npm specified the dependency chain together with deprecation warnings","hah no problem we already fixed in master just need to cherry-pick im mostly complaining about npm here","one thing that might be possible is maybe your project has a babelrc in parent folder","eject shouldnt create babelrc can you reliably reproduce this","only if the list implementation is naive optimized lists can cache elements to short-circuit rerendering","tele_men i dont really do react development these days if you dont include development of react itself which uses fb configs","it doesnt do much except volume these days definitely hoping apps would catch up","actually with npm 3 or yarn you probably dont","jsx uses case for this it uses variable in scope for capital tags and strings for lowercase tags","since web components can have arbitrary names eg ltdate-pickergt we need a way to distinguish them from react components","ah i see no not because of constructors just because this lets jsx know if you meant a custom component or a web component","react functional components are just functions theyre not meant to be constructors at all","not on importing no you dont interact with build tooling its hidden behind a bin script of top-level package","when you edit a file put the cursor into the editor now cmdf should show the editor inline search instead of browsers","even if there is another shortcut to jump to the next result deviating from browser behavior while hijacking it is still unfortunate","i wish github editor didnt hijack the browser search i can never find what it highlighted because its offscreen and then type ltentergts","its not nothing and were working on making it better but startup time is dominated by product code","but the fact that people writing react apps often arent educated enough about code splitting","afaik the people youre talking about agreed that its not reacts startup cost thats prohibitive","all i said is im surprised that two years in redux usage is still growing and this means react could do a better job itself","arrows work just fine if you give them implicit name first const app gt export default app","note you should not use it in production its only meant for quick fiddling or for babel-powered code editors","since the original error is not logged its hard to figure out what happened well fix this in react 16 by crashing harder","if render throws then first

update which will break","yes afaik fb adopted js modules requires long before the wide open source community","why would it facebook doesnt use webpack","i find it valuable to learn about issues in tools im using especially if theres new investigation into causes","problems like this is why its better to wait for create react app to catch up and test everything than to use latest tools immediately","yep useful in case props have changed by the time update is applied","it breaks the build tho","ill still need to test if this doesnt add too much overhead to be on by default in development","if you ran into troubles with cra let us know on the issue tracker we are happy to help","create react app is the official one give it a try -","dear lazyweb why would eventerror be null in some cases inside a window error event listener","just call reactdomrender and in the callback read nodeinnerhtml","i wouldnt suggest doing this on the client anyway because youll have too much

you about user timing api for a minute got a question about how to best use it in react","right but im interested in the opposite inside of react i want to emit events and not worry nobody is listening","the only one i can remember","i dont do product development now but i probably would use blackboxing more if i was","imagine a notice about product price is dropped because render returned an object and react decided to noop instead of crash","for example if doing something is known to bring lib into inconsistent state because it just wasnt designed to support it","react has some strict assertions but they indicate user errors that must be fixed not always possible or desirable to noop","if you have specific suggestions happy to discuss in an issue otherwise its a bit too abstract to help","its the one caused by an earlier error that is either swallowed by user code or ignored by developer","just checked your pr is in master but not in any release yet it is scheduled for 010 which

make off-by-one mistakes tests and running code help catch that dont have those tools on paper","right but its version of async loading was disastrous for perf and its default optimizer produced a single file webpacks ahead","tools follow the language import and require are synchronous thats where defaults are coming from hopefully import will help","i fully agree thats why cra shows a build size difference on every rebuild","to a react power user a preloader component implementation is obvious but many people never consider this help teach them","instead of telling react users to drop it for something with fundamentally the same problems maybe we could teach them to split more code","by framing it as a problem with react apps were missing an important discussion about how to encourage code splitting with any library","in a way react enabled people to build very ambitious uis but technical and educational advance in bundling is not quite there yet","if its an educational issue we could have a page explaining how to load components dynamically","which part is inappropriate lack of high level forcing function to bundle less and split more","by your continued insistence that its react that is bad youre just further fragmenting its ecosystem","right because its popular but replacing react with a slightly smaller alternative wont fix the issue","you say rethink bundling for mobile what your followers hear react-the-library is bad for mobile","the way you single out react when talking about a broader issue of js delivery is frustrating","i agree we should make async-by-default patterns less verbose in react to encourage them though","in neither place did it occur to me to place the blame for my build process on a ui library i use","well i started using react with global ltscriptgt tags now i work at a company using ml for bundling","so when you say react you really mean any ui library that doesnt prescribe a build process","i guess you tie this to react is because its not a framework gt cant influence bundling am i right","i used webpack in cra because its the most popular bundler if better alternatives come well switch","i just honestly dont understand how this is related to react were talking about bundling not ui lib","well add to the docs once other webpack 2 issues shake out and we can settle on dynamic import syntax","are you

with react had to build the missing glue","i notice that earliest work tends to have most influence on future technology","especially for people who want to build out and shape the tooling","for that reason i think code that uses callback form would be easier to rearrange into a more functional version of setstate","the existing callback form of setstate does move react closer to functional not because uses fns but because removes reliance on ordering","would it be correct to describe this as redux and react getting married i think makes that a little simpler","ideally always be returning

exposes plain js strings bucklescript is deeply embracing js reason works with bs","i believe with bucklescript we also get native browser unicode support using the js string implementation","theres 3rd party libs for unicode logic but i like that stringlength returns real byte length unlike js","ocaml strings store raw bytes and you can put unicode inside of them refmt escapes some which is a bug but works","you mean you are aware of a bug or like - its fundamentally incompatible with the idea of unicode support","meaning largest number of hosts a single ocaml app has been deployed to

how well weve been able to start experiencing with the router on native for example","the router only cares about the ui piece same as react react router we expose all our state on history for other

tend to avoid confrontation especially with coders its just too much effort","teaching condescending people how to solve their own use cases with react router v4 exhausts a lot of good will","not yet but we will be soon if i were building something in a few months id definitely use it","yes for sure unless for some reason you start publishing your app as an npm package","since is a global cache i think optimizing for the caching use case makes sense","i think it would be interesting if could optimize loading by serving a bundle over http1","ie is this going to eventually work in other browsers as well","iiiiiiinteresting what about the import graph eg does safari tp know how to import files that bramjs imports","its a vision that has been a long time in the making remember ajaxlibs on

solution","fwiw im hoping we can all move beyond bundling in the next few years my packagejson just keeps growing and growing","ah yes indeed im personally a little more excited about the web version tho","so npm scopes are really just a way to multiply the namespace of the public registry i think","pretty sure anyone could go ahead and publish a babelwhatever package wout your permission","yes exactly but you can still generate the config file ahead of time so systemjs knows how to resolve stuff when it needs to","they address the same fundamental problem but take a different approach","difference between webpack and systemjs seems to be that one is a bundler while the other is designed to require from the network","not sure i think its just es6 modules from here on out tho both webpack and systemjs use them","the loader api allows you to shim where you get the module from so we just tell it to get the package from unpkg","basically ya import statement would stay the same though like import react from react just need a different loader","unfortunately im afraid that already happened","good point i switched it to javascript when i put rollup in the poll","is there a list somewhere of all the events react currently has polyfills for","after using both fairly extensively i cant imagine not having webpack in my toolbelt now its invaluable","i felt the exact same

vote for webpack","people are doing crazy shenanigans w javascript these days best to stick with lua","true i dont remember anyone doing anything with webpack until started advocating it","i think maybe rollup just suffers from lack of widespread support could be an awesome tool in the future","isnt javascript just a rather complex tool for making the computer do what you want it to do","hot

in the same repo but publish separate packages for dom and native routing","fyi react router v4 will be split among a few packages so those who dont need eg dom stuff native wont have to install

relic of a bygone era at apple these days","the headphone jack being on the bottom of the iphone 5 was a great design decision missing that on my google pixel","in other words ltroutegt is our

google inbox fb messenger all my apps are web","cant wait to release the backwards compat layer for react router v4 the haters are gonna love it","thanks weve settled on ltroutegt as the component name easier upgrade path for v2 users beta coming out next week","google pixel ftw","you probably find it easy because youve been working with react for a while theyre good qs for a newb imo","thats what im saying i use them the web app even in the background responds to them its crazy good","i mean itd be nice sure but the web app is pretty freaking great i dont miss the native piece really","agreed just meant compare a less than year old web app with a decades old desktop app","i think its at least as large they say 35m songs ive been happy with it so far","in a lot of ways their

like","happy new year 2017 is gonna be a good one","just got it this afternoon so not sure about ecosystem yet i love google assistant though like siri except useful","just bought a google pixel phone havent ever been this excited about a new phone","in other words instead of installing ubuntu on your server so you can run your app just run your app directly as a vm","for front-end folks imagine running an app wout booting the entire linux kernel instead only import pieces of the kernel that you need","mirageos lets you build unikernelsfully stand-alone specialized kernels that run directly

thought the future of computing would offer more options instead we have fewer","not to mention apple has notoriously bad batteries in everything they sell its annoying","im not my mac has always felt like apple loaned it to me never felt like it was mine","ya exactly im hoping it will be great for dev so i can use it for work still do creative stuff on mac","so using google for my mobile device just makes sense assuming that goes well next is laptop","first thing has gotta be my phone thinking of getting google pixel i already use gmail google calendar etc","im personally going non-apple in 2017 been far too long since i gave the competition a serious shake","even if its not called react will be on the cutting edge of software development for the foreseeable future","i generate files for the browser at build time and publish them to npm but dont commit them they can be served with","react itself took that strategy soon after it was open sourced","fwiw i always use node_env same as react so anyone bundling it already does it","ya genius shuffle on your existing library is awesome would be great for discovery too","genius shuffle for all of apple music given music thats already in my library play stuff you think ill like would be so killer","ill give it a shot just have a hard time trusting native js fns given past experience w differing results","heads up to anyone whos worried about react router api churn v4 is still alpha and were working on smooth upgrade path dont fret","stopped by facebooks vr booth in bryant park nyc the other day first vr experience very cool","stay humble stay relevant otherwise technology will move right along and youll be left in the dust angrily shaking your fists","totally its so common that many editor plugins have been developed solely for find and rename in scope","the more code i write the more anxious i get about wrapping up chunks of it into neat little abstractions early on to keep back the tide","this is also why building large apps is more difficult than building small ones because the tendency to abstract prematurely is greater","in other words the more easily you can refactor your code without breaking stuff the quicker you can arrive at the right abstraction","this is why having tools that are easily composed and rearranged is critical because hitting on the right abstraction requires refactoring","indeed i was looking for elf on apple music","including the command center that held the nuclear launch codes","programming is figuring out the right abstraction over and over again","good thing you guys will have a killer opportunity to fix this in facebooks new phone next year","ah now i remember why ive always avoided wireless keyboards","lots of major players giving it their support hope it works well for polymer devs too","afaict the uptake for has been pretty widespread for most of the npm community","thanks for the tip is yarn working out for polymer devs or still using bower","i think polymer is the only community that really depends on bower is that right can polymer devs use yarn with npm instead","so stylescss was showing in the directory listing but when you requested it directly it wasnt there huh odd","glad to hear it and very happy to hear you found it too boo for tired shaky hands","plus theres already a great toolchain for compiling straight to machine code it really seems positioned well imo","have you looked at the debugging story in ocaml is pretty amazing and bucklescript compiles to js","you dont even have to build this from scratch

environment with real browser testing capabilities eg travis browserstack","or maybe they start with a new class of devices entirely like amazon did with the kindle","need to get a toehold somehow like build a cool little watch or a phone or something even that is a huge task","yep its going to be already kind of is google their phoneslaptops are going to be crazy good in a few years","awesome yes id be happy to as well id like to understand the constraints youre working with","btw my intention was to have a createnativehistory function that does the same on react native","enjoying using my

on","thanks i appreciate your intention","im going to use it as the name of my next js framework","ya i hadnt either until last week decided to give apple music a try which btw is great","yep agree

technology","theres another approach","react makes the problem more complex bc you dont know what youre rendering until","theres no reason why generating html markup needs to be async","the intersection of people who are really good at web and mobile is really really small nobody knows what theyre saying","id love to read more about this anything online that describes your approach in detail","what about a small subset of js ala asmjs","as long as i can use straight-up javascript expressions inside my then im good","ya i think youre right i realize im not smart enough to optimize my jsx as much as a compiler could a template","and if using jsx allows me to avoid that then i guess ill use it for now","agree im not a huge fan of jsx i am a huge fan of not writing my own programming language though","or even angular pages upon pages of docs just so you can learn the custom programming language they invented for you","eventually people are going to come along with requirements that would be easy to solve if you were just using javascript","contrast with jsx or even ejs where you use real javascript in your templates you dont have to re-invent lang constructs","heck i wrote mustachejs and i have to go look up the docs that i wrote in order to use it","this is a huge obstacle for users who cant remember how to do stuff the mustache way so they have to go look up the docs","mustache essentially re-invents a lot of stuff that javascript already gives you loops conditionals variables etc","so eg if you look at the mustachejs project or even the svelte guides you see a bunch of docs about mustache syntax","ya mustaches are a pretty big downer but the idea of building components as html files scoped styles","but i definitely appreciate s perspective here would be a great exercise to invert the mental model","its also very straightforward to read and follow so lots of benefits but my programmer spidey senses are tingling","actually in the end i think duplicating code here will ultimately lead to the smallest bundle size too","ha neither do i especially since in this library youll only ever require one of those files so i think its ok","im basically looking for a more elegant way to do that share the lthistoryprovidergt code between those 3 components wout another component","thats a higher-order component and yes itll add that component to the hierarchy when you use it","im trying to avoid using hocs in your example hocomponent adds another layer to the hierarchy","no no significant problems just large component trees when viewing with react devtools and maybe perf","im looking for a method to essentially mix in behavior into an existing react component class instead of composing","usually to get some behavior or ui in react i make a new component and compose it w others to create stuff","ah sorry by in your react components i meant add lifecycle methods","how do you share code between your react components without introducing more components into the hierarchy you cant say mixins p","ha no way im currently working on react router v4 its a dig on myself as much as anything","ya thats perfect i remember discussing this same idea with react core contribs at the original react conf","so 0x gives us the flexibility to nail down the api and 10 is more of a long-term commitment","i think ideally the jump to 10 will just be a change to packagejson version no code changes","trump promised to let me buy out of state health insurance if it happens may at least give me a few options","just make sure youre testing what the component actually renders and youll be alright dont test propsstate","in ca the only alternative is to just pay out of pocket for everything and pray nothing bad happens","fwiw ive had the same experience as someone who primarily does dev","weve heard this request many times but ltlink componentgt isnt the answer","i think ltlinkgt isnt what you think it is what component are you trying to substitute","in dev i completely agree with you i hate developing on a train or a plane or something with network dependencies","ya i guess we are essentially questioning that assumption at least as far as serving your app in production goes","youre wrong i love web components what are you even saying did you say something bad about them i dont know","so now instead of everyone loading jquery from their own domains we all use the exact same copy from google which is cached","agree this was the original reason that google put up jquery on their cdn back in the day because everyone was using it","once you hit critical mass some interesting things start to happen that could make this possible","imagine for a second if we had a globally-shared node_modules dir and once you downloaded a package you never had to again","no its not terribly odd ive done quite a bit of devops i understand where youre coming from","in other words your entire app could crash right now and you wouldnt be able to do anything about it","thanks jared it was a pleasure meeting you happy to help you guys get react into your stack too","thats exactly the assumption that im questioning i think a partial server render client render is actually faster better ux","indeed id personally love to hear more talks from people like who are experimenting w hybrid apps in 2g markets","yes i think a hybrid approach makes a lot of sense if you can afford the eng hours","and saying stuff like you need ssr for 2g users ignores a lot of possibilities for even better ux w a hybrid approach","even on slow connections and low power devices it doesnt seem like ssr is the answer to your perf problems","i want a completely separate site that i can give to the crawlers so i dont have to mix those concerns w the rest of my app","afaict literally the only thing server rendering is good for these days is seo on search engines that are not google thats it","for so many people this is like the thing that brings them to react but its so much more trouble than its really worth","people think its more important than it is support it is more trouble than its worth it makes your app harder to grok etc","im using the web version i didnt know they had a previous one just started a month ago","i believe was completely designed and built by crazy talented people","this lets you easily just dump a bunch of apps in a directory and go im going to be using this all over the place","yes i believe we still have sooo far to go when it comes to ui design","sure could do that as well just following the lead of react core __","think about it like react-addons you wouldnt just name something that if you werent official","just like react core im sure polymer core has to try and sell people on using their tech internally","i think some of s talk was probably directed at google internally","eg when the condition is falsy your ltifgt component just discards thispropschildren which could potentially be large","the problem is that when the condition is falsy youre just building up a bunch of vdom elements and throwing them away","yep ive built a few components like that in the past i try to avoid the if type components nowadays though","any good links also i suppose the nation splitting led to the code splitting discussion","thats insane never thought id see the day when react was more popular than angular","i put a lot of ternaries inline in my jsx branches that i dont take dont ever execute","i know ive built many apis done lots and lots of normalizing in my

can make the same argument about searching the symbol in the source code which would yield the config","which is still surprising processenv doesnt exist in the browser","arguably this type of source

case of inferno having sync updates on the dom should have better perf","im not entirely sure inferno needs to go down the route of react fiber especially if inferno is only going to target the dom","if you were to trade off library file size for performance how much would you sacrifice im not talking insane trade-offs but small ones","ive heard today that inferno is massively bloated

demographics of users changed used to be people with a decade of web experience and now people learn jsx before html","im glad i no longer have to spend an entire evening just to get a decent setup going configuring all those tools is hard","also react is extremely opinionated a lot of people are talking about the react way of doing things","the getting started experience is by far the most complained about thing on react so it was seemed as broken","do you have suggestions to make the skill cap required lower both in term of technology used and teaching the concepts used","we extracted out the math part for react native animation library so in a sense were using it","i love this app so much","would love to see that happen","cc and who made it happen","cc and who made it happen","create-react-app we released this morning","react native already has a similar experience we want to merge the two at some point but its not easy","if im reading this right react renders in 227ms and preact in 294","our implementation of flexbox is tested against the browsers so it works the same on web","but thats a huge pre-condition and its unclear if its going to be a practical solution for the entire ecosystem","as its going to give you errors as you type in your text editor if you have flow integration same applies for typescript","if you have the ability to flow type your entire codebase and you are not using dynamic checks flow is definitely better","not for react itself since its baked by fb but asking for startups around react several times yeah","i receive so many emails asking for the react marketing team vp of react asking about the react org","we do have a script that does that do you remember where it is","yeah that css-layout upgrade is rough but fortunately this should be the last big one it is wayyy more spec compliant","theres still a ton to figure out and react native is only a first attempt and doing it","id love to see react nativescript happening and make some healthy competition with react native","react native doesnt need to take over the entire screen as long as theres a piece of ui to render you can use it","this means that we dont get it by default on react native","crypto is part of the browser specs w3c webview chrome firefox and not javascript specs tc39 v8 jsc","they got their web rendering already working","the css output is so simple that we dont really need an ast string concatenation works just fine","for our www experiments we have two versions one with regexes to parse the js and one with a babel transform","right now we dont use that in production on the web most of the learnings are from react native","this is how css is written at fb postcss is used for the linter","we actually started a few months before that announcement by recompiling jsc ourself","hopefully the work on moving animations off of the js thread is going to fix it for you","using react i wonder if you have any tips to avoid this kind of behavior","this is terrible ive worked so hard to prevent this from happening there are now hundreds of thousands of ppl","its a really nice project that strikes a balance between using css and solving its problems recommended","or eslint lodash underscorebackbonecoffeescript react-router it pretty crazy how one person can have a huge impact in js","for the you need fb resources to be successful this helps but isnt required see redux and babel one person made huge impact","if those talks are the benchmark im more than happy with it being okay","inferno looks so good i want to figure out a way to bring those concepts to mainland react im glad it the talk was useful","yeah it looks more like a browser than a node environment","i think the best part about react europe so far is the number of non-native english speakers that are delivering awesome talks","its also a way to showcase a few companies that you could join if youre looking to work with react","the truth is a conference like this costs a lot of money and tickets are not enough sponsors help make it happen","many of the speakers are not native english speakers all the talks have been heavily rehearsed speaking isnt easy","its the reason why i want react native for web badly","this is a from scratch reimplementation of css-layout from microsoft which is way more spec compliant than the current one","we agreed we want react-native but im not sure if it has been implemented yet","im glad that my hacky way of reverse engineering css based on random tests against the browser is now gone","this way it fits well in a react app but has the perf you need","you can make a ltmygridgt component that just renders a div and use raw dom manipulation to impl it","if it doesnt meet your perf requirements you should just not use those technologies","i had no idea that react turned 30 javascript time is going fast","ive written html and css since i was 10 so i have had my fair share of experience with it if that makes you feel any better","yeah react native is still very early","i also used react for server-side only websites with no client side interaction basically as a php framework","for react native website is to generate a static website on github","those render the native ones for those components it makes very little sense to reimplement them","for react native were trying to limit the surface area of whats in core and promote third party components instead","this is so exciting good luck with that dream ps a react flag at the top would be sick","for windows hopefully itll get better now that microsoft is invested in react native for linux its going to be tough","btw most of the development at facebook is on the android part of react native right now so likely going to change","this goes with the mantra of learn once write anywhere doing something cross platform right from the start usually fails","one platform and then if that is successful then make it awesome on the second platform and the third","cross platform is hard i think that this is a good trade-off to start delivering extremely good developer experience on","could we bake codemods inside of react-native upgrade","the use of key has not changed since we open sourced react and unlikely to in the future","in the meantime if it is blocking you you can implement an api that lets you call setz and bringtofront","also need to ensure that it has the same edge cases on ios android and web","at the cost of performance we have the prod build designed to be fast and used by tons of users","were not trying to cheat here but to educate people we make a trade-off in dev build to give a ton of warnings","thats exciting if you make it work lots of people are going to be happy","z-index shouldnt impact css-layout should figure out how to bind the attribute to whatever ios support","rn remains a small project theres like 30 people working on it google may have 1000 people working on chrome","do you know any mobile website that has great and performant gestures and animations on safari","ryosukeniwa good incentives for the platform to give a lit of controls and devs to use them","ryosukeniwa the way native apps model works is that you are killed if you take too much memoryits on the app dev to manage it","ryosukeniwa in native land you can just use the actual implementation of the encoder and it just works","ryosukeniwa yeah thats one of those things if the browser dont give you an api youre kind of stuck with suboptimal choices","the decoding part was 1 second so we didnt spend more time trying to optimize the rest","my memory is hazy i think that safari ios didnt implement web worker transferable at the time","would be nice to have a web api to know if an image is in cache without fetching it though","we compiled libjpeg via emscriptem and running it in a web worker and sending back base64 string","at time we experimented one big bottleneck was synchronous decoding by the browser","anyway sorry for all the replies i personally really want the web to win and i believe that rn helps","how do i know if an image is in the browser cache the only way i know is by doing new imagesrc xxx","at all time is very difficult with the browser chrome getting in the way cant disable gestures like","implementing a photo viewer on mobile web is crazy you cant have it full screen knowing screen size","so you cant implement instagram creation flow on mobile web right now correct me if an api does exist","not sure what you mean there is no web api to display the camera with a custom ui","were also doing comparisons with things like componentkit which have same concepts as react but in ios","well this is a longer route to influence the web but we are providing a ton of value for fb in between","i do not know trying to balance solving problems for fb and advancing the web","by controlling the browsers we were able to implement things ive always wanted like layout animation","using the exact same code the non optimized one everything was 60fps outputting uiviews and uiimages","when we started the project we couldnt get 60fps on mobile web with those primitives driven by js","we made a lot of hard api trade-offs to get rn theorically working on web havent prioritized it yet","the size cost is also very important on web since you download everything all the time","maybe now react native was started 3 years ago none of those worked on mobile web at the time","the output of react native ignoring react is just a bunch of div image and text using inline style","i see react native in the same vein as amp take a subset of the web and try to make it fast","id love to kill the whole react native project and use the browser instead","we use in a faster way if yes then we can go to browser implementors with a test case and theyll","for removing the dom and using webgl this is the same idea can we reimplement a subset of the dom that","comparison well be able to know for sure and hopefully improve the browsers in the process","or because the browser implementations are actually slow or a mix of both by having a head to head","i dont know if the web on mobile feels slow compared to native apps because we dont write good code","but my hope is that well be able to run the same code on ios android and web and see how it performs","and the goal is that well know how things work under the hood and be able to provide an alternative","react native is basically a browser that implements a subset of what the web supports","nor have enough knowledge to be able to know what changes should be made to the browsers to fix it","a bigger context is that since fb doesnt own a browser theres little ways to influence the browsers","while we dont use css the language theres a spec compliant implementation of the css layout engine","the idea behind react native is an experiment to figure out web the good parts","need for google to ship it or give more information about it but the answer is likely going to be yes","hmm that was 5 years ago i was probably thinking about a babel-like system","im not convinced that the best practices we have today in css are working its still a major source of bugs and frustration","for mixins if you are using js to declare your styles you dont need to extend the css language to achieve the same results","nesting is used to scope css rules to a certain element but with react youve got the component model as a boundary","for pseudo elements like before and after you can just create them in the dom instead super easy with react","its a separation of concern through convention not through a different technology","for percentage this is something that i want but not yet implemented what do you mean by alternative layout models","im curious what are the things you are missing in react native","in all those years weve never gotten around to open source our implementation at fb glad the angular team is doing it","note that if you use reactcreateclass it auto binds all methods so it just works","the issue is that you cannot use shouldcomponentupdate anymore since you cant really introspect functions","the issue is that you cannot use shouldcomponentupdate anymore since you cant really introspect functions","yeaaahhhh npm install has gotten way slower","breaking changes have much slowed down on ios side of react native as it matured and i expect the same to be true for android","good idea we already link the js click edit on github but we could make it more obvious","those are names are terrible i kept them on react native for compatibility but still unsure was right call","i dont think so we need gesture negotiation apis i havent seen any proposal for them","no and this is the point if you dont get this correct a lot of web versions dont then you have accidental clicks","the tricky part is to make it interop between an normal app using the dom and this other system","not really we have a graph library built on-top of react art internally but not going to oss it anytime soon","this is awesome bringing native deployment system to the web","shaundunne for transition animations were working on offloading them out of the js thread which is not yet turned on by default","shaundunne can you expand on what your problem is with the camera roll access we call straight to the native apis for this","my philosophy with that is that you should change the dom ordering instead of having a magical prop in css doing it","i started css-layout and what you built look super similar wanted to see if there some way we can collaborate","doesnt really matter who did it first as long as best ways of building uis spread","fun fact we merge an average of 55 pull requests a day on react native and that represents half of the commits","in case it wasnt clear it was a joke writing code and shipping stuff gtgtgt arguing on twitter","see react-native-web","the reason master is not updated is that it is synced with facebook codebase and unfortunately takes around an hour to update","chances are what you are experiencing is not built with react native but yeah sorry about your bad experiences","id accept a pull request that does a warning if the a component is gt 10","id accept a pull request that does a warning if the a component is gt 10","congratz on the funding cant wait to see what cool stuff you are going to build with that money","yeah sorry about that but i decided it was better to only use a sane subset of css","if you look at the issue someone already created a babel transform that strips out the code for unused platform"],"charset":["t","h","a","n","k","s","
