in a 2 day rxjs trainingworkshop","sorry thought it was obvious the example was contrived just to clarify that im talking jsx and that jsx react components","indeed its basically xml in javascript as you know its called jsx for a reason","guess im tryin to figure out if its jsx u dont like for this or specifically that people doing it w react components","if jsx just transpiled to invoke the function immediately without virtual element would you still share this view","the laziness of virtual elements in react has its pros and cons","if they were optimized to only be virtual element lazy invocation as they say it will be some day","dare i say that react rally was the best conference ive attended so far on the whole content people all-around fun i had","indeed that happens too","what happens in utah stays in utahunless its on a podcast","there are optimizations minifiers and browsers could do on es6 that they cant on es5transpiled","people just often unknowingly apply it after their build step to es5","this is definitely going to be a common question since in most peoples builds its not necessarily obvious","i wanted to come but react rally overlapped","i dont know the history between rxjs and rxjsrx namespaceswell look into it tho","try importing from the root import observable from rxjs not rxjsrx","i prefer webpack stew","you wont believe what happens next jessica","ie if i npm install inside my module it doesnt run but if someone npm install my-module it does--they depend on my module","npm is there a way for your module to run a postinstall script when it is a dependency but not local dev of itself","double check that this call is happening when you think it is right now its happening once when your app boots","any reason youre using the fetch api promises instead of observableajax would reduce boilerplate and be cancellable","-- then redux-saga is leader atm if you know or want to rxjs our redux-observable is similar to redux-saga but rx","i typically suggest redux-thunk if your app doesnt have complex side effect requirements if it does--","hey will you work on my project which is a tool to organize projects you get asked to do","fans will appreciate it im sure even tho hes not on twitter","darkbasic qbasic visual basic visual j jscript php c","sure but thats by choice because ember considers the tradeoffs unacceptable footguns","if tc39 ever does finalize rxjs-style observables in the javascript standard mobxs usage of the term is going to be a little awkward","yeah if youre an ember dev who wants to switch to react it might be a more natural transition than alternatives","no one is really saying this yet but mobx is so nearly identical to embers bindings its uncanny","build a wall around svg","people are saying this bug happens a lot","i assume youre not using angular2 i would peek at their implementation since it was fairly well thought out","how the f do you find those bins tho my jsbin history is a nightmarewhat am i doing wrong","summary i think theres too much focus on academicsprogress in the the react community and it hinders shipping","just thought it would naturally happen somewhere from the community some have tried obviously but nothing gained traction et","reread this and wanted to clarify i didnt mean its the reacts responsibly to create a full framework","instead people that have most things in common webpackreduxreact-routeretc just call it a react app which is weird to me","always assumed react would become one part of a complete framework like angularember isstill waiting","in case you havent i do recommend trying to build a simple app with ember-cli that requires addons","imo react community could use more convention over configuration for tooling with escape hatches","addons for sure ability to ember install something and it just works is godsend","if i could write code that only runs successfully with spaces not tabs i would","but not true if from outside like raw addeventlistenerjqueryetc where it isnt part of the current runloop","i assume someone has answered but just in case no signif as long as its inside react event will be batched","navigation related stuff can cause different code paths eg query params","since i dont work on those native teams i really dont know what im talking about tho","i dont work on nething nativeafaik we dont use rn anywhere we have custom rn equiv not sure how that team tests","indeed ive seen this before with certain css gpu accel stuff in websites too","nope but will turns out it only happens when i have window at my full monitor widthheight so its a render perf thing","figured it out i have a rather largehigh res monitor and vs code performs awful when i have its window at full widthheight","startup in atom is much worse but once up it openscreates files very snappy guessing im cursed","no plugins yet installed for vscode sublime has tons and is a champ on my box","trying to give vs code a chance but is noticeably slower on everything open close typing etc vs sublime is this normal or am i cursed","if nearly anyone could create them npm update could run them automatically current creation tooling is lacking","oh trust me ive seen this its awesome my issue is broad adoption of ability to create codemods","exactly i just wish i had the cycles cause i see real potential and real solutions such is life as a dev","ast transforms aka codemods are incredibly powerful might one day upgrade all our apps automatically need tooling to create them easily","in practice this is a bad idea tho cause apps have state hehe just clarifying for the dry by readers","isnt tco not planned to be implemented by any browser but safari","what happens if you change your eslint preferences later","hard for them to understand that many of us enjoy writing code and oss is an outlet to learn and explore untethered to business ideals","try to explain to an average non-tech person how open source software used by nearly everything is largely made by non-paid volunteers","ajax asynchronous javascript and xmlthe good old days of xml for serialization will haunt us by name forever","yup theyre the same pattern just different tools to implement that pattern","its extremely declarative which is awesome but only if youre familiar with reactive programming or can get so","also--since im not an angular2 dev i just might not see where needing to custom-brew is necessary to provide the best dx","i get it just respectfully disagree with these approaches","the knowledge of redux-sagas operators doesnt directly apply elsewhere where as you can use rx knowledge for many things","maybe some day reactive programming will be prolific enough that it makes sense but today is not yet that day","you can implement redux with rxjs instead but is there a strong reason they have strong community dev tools lots of middleware etc","interested to know what it was if easy to explain to someone without a lot of angular2 knowledge i know zones tho","if i had to make a totally absolute guess perhaps something related to code webpacks hot reloading
