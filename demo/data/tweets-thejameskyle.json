point but allowing it everywhere lets you have the freedom to make smarter choices","routes may often be the worst way to do code splitting on","the difference i was trying to highlight is route-centric vs component centric code splitting","i dont agree design frameworks in a way that makes every component a splitting point no human intervention","it was almost presented like nuclide was the only editor that was designed to work for fbs codebase","does jsdom not want to add it","i love its all of the things i always tried to build manually on top of other testing frameworks but built in and done well","please remember that when you are at a company party you are representing that company and company policies still apply","he ended up getting fired the very next day which i applaud the company for","he was drunk and acting like an asshole all night hitting on his co-workers and saying very inappropriate shit","if the javascript community has been so successful teaching using different terminology then maybe those are better terms","ive heard a lot of people over the years criticize the javascript community for inventing terms for things that already have a name","ember kinda coined the term tree-shaking afaik p","maybe i wouldnt approach it that way though","was starting to talk to about this the other day decided conversation needed to happen in person p","ember still misses the mark but is closer because it doesnt rely on the module system for sync loading","if you cant do this without rewritingmoving tons of code then its a non-starter","with a large tree of components you need to be able to split anywhere in between","this still needs to be component-centric because uis but it needs to account for the entire module system","but if you limit it to just components instead of modules youve lost a lot of opportunity","basically theres a tool that needs to exist that does not exist and will not be a part of browsers","the interesting bit might come in the form of static analysis around web components thats where id start","the problem in there then lies in how we enable this for more modules and things shared between many components","this is very similar to relay but for components","what is saying is if we have a tree of components like this youll see one load then another then another all the way down","you can do this with any component framework out there some more interesting than others","i thought that shouldve been the router before because of ember but based on what ive learned at fb it needs to be more granular","but there needs to be something more in react or ecosystem to better enable this","its pretty much there its just functions and elements that can be created whenever most code is already decoupled from sync operations","right now react apps require too much to be synchronously loaded itd be nice if anything could be async and we could split whereever","this is where i think ember gets a lot right things are enforced decoupled at the route layer code splitting is relatively trivial","i think a lot of the difficulty around optimizingcode splitting react apps is going to be that the app is the entry point instead of routes","indiana appears in my top 10 places i have followers for some reason","also i owe you my shitty code i keep forgetting","one persons unmaintained website is another persons lifeline","if your company is gonna fire a successful open source developer because of performance then i promise its your company with the problem","tools like rollup amp wp2 easily could have been built on commonjs by enforcing certain restrictions that they already had","ill just note that im also not a fan of compiling modules with babel anymore","this is exactly what i wanted thank you but omg i cant believe thats the api for this","havent you heard we should stop using tools and treating the web like we can build native-like apps","__ i would just copy what most tools are already doing toolrc is pretty common","i think the discoverability problem is created when you use packagejson too easy to miss in all the other config","you could create another packagejson i believe but thatd be weird","you could create another packagejson i believe but thatd be weird","they said its the first of many upcoming design tweaks","it takes years to build a programming language also years to teach the community our destinations could meet if we tried","im not an extremist here i want to help build the bridge between you and what you currently view as unapproachable"]
