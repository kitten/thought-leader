after calling constructor","which ones fb only organizes reactconf as far as i know not aware of any investments","what do you find opinionated about react i generally hear the opposite criticism not opinionated enough too many choices","ultimately the effect you describe happens with any successful tech and if it wasnt react or redux it would be something else","yes people may misuse react even more so redux fyi redux is my personal project and has zero relationship to facebook","it uses webpack so supports requireensure for that","not sure what you mean react itself doesnt have any dependencies and we definitely encourage you to only use stable versions","we dont really work on anything except react itself some other people might have experimented with something like that","by the way you have potential pitfall there with catch make sure you always log errors or youll swallow errors in your code","can you show a code snippet","for babel plugin yea we dont currently allow that for service-mocker not suredont see why it wouldnt work","try rm -rf node_modules and then npm install again","note that this still wont preserve component state or dom but will prevent reloads and preserve state outside components","with some projects like react hot loader i tried to automate it but its not reliable enough to be on by default yet","this api is enabled by default that is it is available in cra apps css uses it automatically thats why it doesnt refresh page","i mean that if you do aot without sacrificing expressiveness the helpers basically become the library","i think aot is super cool but like with any advanced optimization eg tree shaking i think theres some misplaced hopes too","the only reason we dont do it by default is because it doesnt work on npm2","as mentioned in readme though the workaround is adding literally a single line to packagejson","i assumed they dont exist because even webpacks own analyzer used to show pre minified size only","this penalizes libraries with dev only warnings because makes them look bad compared to ones without dev mode","its pretty frustrating that webpack exposes wrong info for tools like this then people blame libraries for being big","is it correct though i remember webpack stats used to measure size before minification","we better ship that profile build though could look confusing","lets call them twice in dev and ignore the result of one call","context api will change but of course with migration path everyone incl us depends on it","how much maybe webpack 2 has some bundling overhead file an issue","im happy to answer specific questions if something is unclear but i cant reduce a whole issue to one no or yes answer","what about lifting state up setstate works fine with subtrees with many components","looks fine to me for rapid prototyping you can always break them apart later","its a known issue and wont be solved until react-scripts010","what is confusing you yes i think 052 is latest stable version its versioned separately from react-scripts","just make sure that your webserver doesnt serve cached html when it has changed and the rest should work out of the box","if source was different then hashes will be different in filenames so unless html is cached somehow it will bust caches","not sure honestly i dont think so most of it is very old code","but api indeed needs more work were on it -","im not saying its the first thing to learn but it is an essential part of react and cant really be skipped","theres a secret unstable release of react-scripts thats using webpack 2 if you can find it give it a try and report any issues","you can use render callback pattern inside those components similar to how react motion works","react team member checking in please learn to use setstate before other approaches","trying to make rn work with a rollup-produced flat react bundle","that said react itself works with the dom so it cant possibly be faster than equivalent dom mutations written by hand","it creates an internal object for each component including platform-specific like div they are retained tho","react just keeps objects around which have current props on them thats about it it doesnt recreate trees of them","theres no full vdom thats the problem this is a misunderstanding of how react works it doesnt create vdom trees","thats internals im referring to the api design","early on it was important to emphasize were not actually replacing all html on every single render","im not sure who came up with the term but it definitely helped early adoption of react as the whole idea was too new","im personally not a fan of wrapping js data structures into ones provided by a library prefer to have control","again the point of react isnt being fast its diving ui in declarative components it only helps if browser is fast","so no applying dom changes is usually pretty fast although of course it can trigger layouts and paints","all of the above is reconciliation we call applying dom changes a commit and its done in a single pass in fiber","the more expensive part is calling react components recursively to learn which elements they render to and diffing child lists","what do you mean by vdom is updated in react all that happens is internalinstanceprops newelementprops","so can reconciling too many layers of react components on every update","using local state is absolutely fine if it was bad then it would not exist in react","sure youll bump the version number of react-scripts as usual and follow instructions in changelog","you can return just the parts that changed react merges it into the state itself","its okay but prevents any components below including nested from preserving local state","right generally this is a pattern to avoid state derived from props if you really need it use componentwillreceiveprops","what do you mean react doesnt recycle instances or anything like this mind filing an issue to discuss","if props change your state goes stale if you really really need it think twice then componentwillreceiveprops is your friend","this looks like a good proposal want to file an issue in eslint-plugin-react","i dont really see the value in adding a library where removing some code will do for other use cases sure -","lots of snarky people on twitter seem to care search for create react app mb","apple hasnt had any issues with rn apps because rn doesnt expose arbitrary native apis to js","i would also suggest beginners to use an approved setup create react app instead of rolling their own because of this","many people read a guide like this and dont realize this is only relevant for development and they must envify in production","absolutely i didnt expect that it would feel that way but not having to open xcode is magic great work","of course but i think this is a much better approach than sarcastic remarks on twitter about the same issue","i wish that werent the case but people do develop blind spots same reason you can read pages without reading ads","i only have experience with javascript development tools not native","if youre interested the company im

to turn this reference into actionable advice applicable in npm ecosystem","if you can show me a js bundlertest runnerservercompilerminifier suite in less mb lets discuss","suggesting systems which have zero overlap with needs of react users as examples also comes off as troll-ish","suggesting we remove bundling today because browsers will support that in 6 months per seems like a troll","if you have constructive ideas on how to make build dependencies thinner you are welcome to post them","always happy to unfortunately facts dont make for viral tweets easier to devalue hard work of contribs","of course its the tooling the app is 40 kb but that clarification doesnt make for a nice tweet","fair enough thats the explicit design goal to limit control in exchange for easy

community uses","if tooling gets more stable within a year then maybe","webpack 2 is still too new some things are broken babel has plugin ordering issues etc","we are talking about size of build dependencies think xcode i agree it would be nice to slim them down","hello world with react is 40 kb the size you are quoting is build dependencies compiler test runner etc","have you measured size of your boilerplate sounds like youre using exact same tools as us","hello world size is 40 kb delete react and it is zero not sure what you are talking about","there are npm client alternatives that use global cache and symlinks so you can use that to save space","please raise an issue if you have a problem happy to help","customize as little as you can so you dont develop attachment","im talking about crna new thing for react native but a fix for webpack would be great for cra -","i can totally see this being the first native toolkit for many people making an otherwise unapproachable world closer like vb6 was for me","i think create react native app will turn out more important than people realize works on windows and doesnt need gbs of native tooling","the difference is it lets you try rn without installing native tools eg xcode or android studio definitely not required though","if we dont engage when disagreeing web development community gets fragmented into silos and echo chambers of mutual agreement","anyway thank you for writing up this feedback on twitter i appreciate it even though youre not a fan","theres nothing preventing the tool from getting leaner in the futurewe meet our users where they are now to serve their needs","as far as i know most our users care both about supporting older browsers but thanks for sharing the perspective","it would be easy to solve with a global installation like xcode but that makes it hard to work on multiple projects","you can get started with react with one html file and a script tag but youll want to write modular code in larger apps","this toolkit is for real apps and its sandboxed how large is a global xcode installation","yes and it includes a compiler a linter a web development server with live reloading a minified and a test runner","if you just want style to pass through from above delete that line props will get forwarded to connected components by default","comparing style you pass as prop from app with something called style in your redux state","what are you struggling with theyre just props passed to the component","reactconf going tight will rewatch many talks","yea but important to take tooling and use cases into consideration see the rest of the thread","for what its worth fb code still uses commonjs and a custom require implementation you dont need latest syntax to ship products","if you measure the results and they make a difference for your app maybe you could switch to commonjs in the meantime","two amendments first yes there are smarter tools gcc 99 react users arent using them so its not very relevant today","this is not advice on how to use react its analysis of a commonly misunderstood snippet ive seen people suggest on the net","oh i definitely dont mean anyone should change their imports i think its pretty pointless and should be solved by tooling","thats cool im worried about fragility how can you be sure third party deps dont import react in funny ways","why doesnt babel do this it doesnt know that reactcreateelement never changes es module imports may change and babel tries to interop","here is something interesting though changing jsx pragma to use createelement can and likely will make your app bundle smaller","it is also better for server rendering because a single optimized bundle is faster","this makes sense for react because its not a utility package like lodash or bootstrap you cant use 50 of react","this lets us remove some browserifywebpack junk code at module boundaries and optimize bundle further with more aggressive techniques","interestingly we are actually moving into the opposite direction for react we are going to compile our packages in a single file each","for source code yes but for the bundle the plan is the opposite compile it to one file regardless of environment","note that unless were in hypothetical world where react ships es this removes the use of proptypes but wont remove the code","i mean that it will be es modules package someday so maybe youll save 30 bytes not importing cloneelement or something","unfortunately there is too much misinformation about everything including js if you cant tell if info is legit reach out to maintainers","theres no advantages react package isnt a library like lodash or bootstrap with many apis you can selectively choose","theres nothing else in react package that you could tree shake

react package are createclass and dom factories were deprecating them anyway","in theory yes well get there when the ecosystem is ready right now it is a mess its a turbulent period and we stick with what works","third party components published to npm may use for example requirereactcreateclass how could the bundler safely delete it","in particular even if your bundler supports it it only works for libraries published as es6 modules react isnt","tree shaking is not something magic you should create a tiny library and see how it works for yourself too much misinformation","theres a myth making the rounds that importing less from react package makes bundle smaller no it doesnt","if you see saving its because jsx output is short","note react is not es module package","your webpack config is likely broken please try create react app and compare","cap_colors this is why you need a known good setup like cra instead of letting every engineer change webpack config","cap_colors seriously though tools are not bad but they are too easy to misconfigure","for what its worth it is exactly how fb and most large companies using react -","not sure what exactly youre asking but whats wrong with calling reactdomrender twice with different target dom nodes","no idea but i wouldnt try to think from redux point of view how would you do this in plain js","curious why this wouldnt help eg ufi note that the proposal doesnt behave like bootloadedcomponent","interesting code splitting at least crude always seemed easy to me but ssr seemed hard","we should try to figure out why it breaks but i still dont understand why install more tools before trying existing ones","noticed a problem with create react app people cant believe it works out of the box and try installing webpackbabel on top breaking it","this could be better if more libraries explained migration path and change motivations and more developers didnt treat alphas as stable","developer this api is flawed and doesnt let me do x y and z developer also you are an asshole for changing it","so were trying to move react itself away from that so that we have full control over how its bundled","its also not using webpack or anything like this theres a lot of custom infrastructure for bundling js","and not its fully synchronous nature complicated code splitting antimodular middleware etc these problems

solutions on different cpumemoryreadability spectrum just like with any other tool","if youre running 800 redux dispatches in a second maybe redux isnt the best tool -","also fb always relied on

in template to violate it","better build then maybe removing some code","its hard to optimize anything and also hard to change internals because ppl rely on private apis","we are slowed down very much by different build processes in oss rn and www","the plan is to push the whole proptypes library to userland and let community improve it","react uses long module names and they turn into long

anything its the devtools code i didnt understand not pr itself","context is broken in current version but well solve it eventually for deep updates with a different api","i see then i guess webpack should expose blessed cache","you dont have a flash if the library can wait for you","anyway yea better to work on proof of concept in react -","the server rendered markup would stay until promise

think npm link will work what didnt work the first copy paste way","npm run build in react folder then copy buildnode_modules into your projects node_modules manually","unfortunately user timing api doesnt have support for prefixes so emoji is the best we can do to avoid taking precious space","if we always emit marksmeasures in dev we have to prefix them somehow for people who read measurements

are helpful can you propose an alternative for what cra should do","create react app is not a library it is a package integrating oss build tools how are we positioned to solve this","attacking us over this makes just as little sense as attacking babel for example but thanks for your concern","if you want to solve the problem you should bring it up with npm eg yarn lockfiles are first step","im not saying its safe im saying it is exactly as safe as status quo in npm ecosystem for better or worse","create react app curates and packages what the community has already settled on in a cohesive way thats it","if this is a concern for you i presume you dont use tools like babel webpack jest etc many cant afford that","you can apply this argument to anything in npm ecosystem use lockfiles and

uses fb configs","it doesnt do much except volume these days definitely hoping apps would catch up","actually with npm 3 or yarn you probably dont","jsx uses case for this it uses variable in scope for capital tags and strings for lowercase tags","since web components can have arbitrary names eg ltdate-pickergt we need a way to distinguish them from react components","ah i see no not because of
