components into rust and compiling them to webassembly","i'm happy it's helpful :)","at we have a program called tech speakers that will fund travel. there are other activities that are part of it, too","really looking forward to seeing this at jsconf eu next week","happy to hear that, thanks!","we should start one of those programmer twitter memes, except everyone just tweets their devenv setup instead of humblebrags","i've contacted you before about this with no response. you are using my likeness on your website without my consent","very happy to hear that!","kinda silly that the article says facebook hasn't talked about fiber before","kinda related, the webpack team has been talking about making it possible to do things like require .rs and .cpp files","not near a computer right now, but it's examples/fiber/index.html in that repo iirc","yes, it's in the examples directory in the react repo","thanks for suggesting. removed node_modules and cleared npm cache. still see it after subsequent install. anything else i should try?","i'm trying to step through and understand how the bytecode interpreter works, but mapping is all wonky","ember folks... have you ever seen source mapping (for glimmer files in node_modules) be all messed up?","thank you :) it's very appreciated","thank you, matt... you asking me to speak at react rally actually played a big part in code cartoons becoming a thing","and more that it makes me wonder whether that level of analysis and perfectionism would be applied if i were a dude","thanks, i appreciate it, especially from you :) the big bummer for me is less that it makes me doubt my performance...","a big ugh to there being an in depth analysis of whether or not i have any verbal tics on the hn post about react 15.5.0","do you mean the opcodes?","i've heard the idea of a typescript++ mentioned. i assume it would include more specific types for numbers","there has been some talk of this. it requires gc (which is a future feature of wasm) and fully typed code","i'll be giving it at jsconf eu a few days later, and that will be recorded","because people usually build up that obj using state currently on the instance but that may not reflect state currently in progress","for added authenticity, the version on the left half of the screen was actually rendered using reactdom","thanks for the compliment and appreciation","yessss. i can provide much source material for this script","thank you so much! it was challenging to pull it together but i was really happy with the way it fell into place","agreed. the thing that strikes me about react is how many on the core team are highly emotionally intelligent, empathetic & thoughtful","i agree on those points, but also can't expect community norms to be reflected in behavior of everyone with reactjs in their profile","that's rad. what app is that that makes it look like a finger painting?","thank you, really appreciate it","if it helps there've been far more retweets than applications. send an email to lclark@mozilla.com if you are still interested","funny enough, i'll be there this may for jsconf eu. i'll ping :)","there are guys who don't like any programs for underrepresented groups in tech","fortunately the content has been recorded so you should have access to it through the reactconf youtube soon","one thing i do is put it on youtube to get the automated transcript and then use fancyhands to correct it","thank you so much! between this and the wasm one, it's been exhausting, but i'm super happy with how they turned out","that one isn't great for step-through debugging, but shows you how to make fiber work. then creat your own small app","you can actually dive in now. i'd recommend looking at the fiber dir in the examples in react codebase","i don't know if they have plans for it but there's a place in the code where they could add heuristics to make an educated guess","fingers crossed, the next topic (after what wasm means for react) will be browser internals (like css system, renderer, etc)","it would be decode. i'll be staying in berlin at that point, so can only come for 1 night :(","i haven't posted them (i think they are approximately 2 gigs of unoptimized images), but the video should be up soon","i don't know if the react team has written that up, but there's a fiber example in the examples directory that helps","but it might turn out different if webassembly is in the mix","with webworkers you can, and the react team did some experiments with it, but they as i understand it didn't get great results","nice! glad it didn't disappoint","ha, now i'm imagining brad pitt and lupita nyong'o giving my tech talk a standing ovation.","so glad to hear it! this is exactly why i do code cartoons","very happy to hear this","they will likely be the same (a cartoon intro to webassembly), but i might do what wa means for react in hamburg","this actually happened to me at my first cs conf, and it was tim berners lee","yeah, getting html data formats like rdfa or microdata into your templates can be surprisingly tricky","but lots of framework developers are experimenting with it to see how they can boost perf with it","one of my articles mentions react explicitly. you don't have to care since you are unlikely to need write wasm modules yourself","we've started talking about this with the webpack team and there's a channel with some discussion about it in the webpack slack","a native speaker in our community will review, and then we'll add links back to yours from the originals","this was approved :) just add attribution & links back to the originals and send me links to the translation once it's done.","a native speaker in our community will review, and then we'll add links back to yours from the originals","funny enough, i'll be talking about what webassembly means for react at","it could, but for now it's still too soon to say. the future features i mention in part 6 need to happen first","that just means it's not particularly fast for that app. we've benched other apps which we'll likely pub results for soon","will have cartoons about react's new reconciler and what webassembly means for react soon","once you can directly access to the dom and use built-in gc and once js-wasm tools are in place, i could see it","i think it will take a few years for standard and tooling to get to a place where it's possible","yes! i'll be talking about exactly that idea at react europe","that's nice to hear, thank you! looking forward to seeing you at reactconf","with a vengence this year. i'll have a cartoon about fiber in 2 weeks, and then one about what webassembly means for react","heads up, friends... there's gonna be a lot of code cartoons in your feed this week","yeah, i really liked nand to tetris. i haven't tried stanford's compiler one","there's a course / book that does a good job of teaching basics (logic gates -> assembler -> compiler -> os) if that's helpful","i keep thinking we need to make a league of extraordinary code cartoonists","however, it doesn't mean that i'm a \"real developer\" and anyone who hasn't done that is not","yeah, but you can say the same of any extra learning. i just designed cpu and ram chips. that knowledge makes me understand more","like i said, don't want to give the guy attn so i'm not linking to him. it applies in all contexts where \"real dev\" is invoked, tho","yeah, my internal \"true developer\" is always 2 years more experienced than me","i'd even take money out of the equation there. if you've coded a thing and it worked, then , you are a real developer","you're not a true developer unless you've designed you own basic logic gates","oh we are for sure making karaoke happen","yeah, i hadn't tried that fancy newfangled thing called react at that point","i will say this: these \"no true developer\" dudes always draw the cutoff point for \"real developer\" right at the boundary of their own skill","\"if you can't do it w/o tools u aren't webdev\". don't want to give it more attn but i'm sure you'll see it in your stream today","yeah, this too. but i also just want to snark on him b/c he's a tool trying to shame other people to make himself famous","i'm conflicted. i want to snark on *that dude* about his \"real web developer\" schtick, but also don't want to give him a platform","new webassembly code cartoon is getting so close!","have vscode code snippets stopped working for anyone else?","i agree, usually poorly explained. i have a code cartoon that explains this a bit (specifically re: js performance) coming soon","i have a code cartoon series coming soon","tbh, i don't know enough about what happened on the ground to comment on the protest tactics used","i have no words, but am so angry to see this happening to you and others","anyone ever come across a fast enigma code cracking implemention in js?","there's also a decoder for webassembly (at least in firefox), which kinda serves the same function as a parser","what app do you use for drawing?","i think that emscripten recently changed to make it possible to ship far less. i'll be looking into this soon","i lucked out. they are letting me do code cartoons full time (mostly about webassembly, rust, and servo)","you mention daily yoga... i'm doing the same for rsi and a thing that has helped me is the gaiam yoga studio app for my phone","i'll have to run it by my boss (lots of travel already in the calendar this year) but would be happy to if i can","dan said he plans an in depth one once the code stops moving around so much","indeed, it opens up so much time. i could get my morning jog in during the time it took for a full firefox build","as someone who has worked on a large c++ app lately, can confirm","same. i just started this coursera course where you \"build\" a computer from scratch","in some cases, 3 (private convo) is not an appropriate request to make. there is lots of writing about this","who then 3) do not respond appropriately to the feedback (as man have reported) then calling out is the right move","ugh, that is super disappointing","cool, i'd love to hear about it if you find a technique","yeah, my experiment was with webplatform. just prelim, but operations like creating+appending elements were slower","thanks, yeah i have checked that out. unfortunately in my experiment with that it's slower but i might be missing an optimization","i've just started playing around with this (rust + wasm) too. do you have code up anywhere? would love to take a look","i just did this for the first time in my last pr and i can totally see that becoming my next big js bug","i hadn't even though of the fact that it *does* sometimes work in js. no wonder my mind keeps thinking \"oh, this will work\"","i've started contributing to servo a bit, and also looking at possibilities for integrating with js via emscripten","leaning rust is ruining me for javascript","i was a senate intern in 99-00. we also weighted calls higher than letters. i don't remember if we even checked email","when i don't capture that in a tool outside of my inbox, then every time i open my inbox i'm recalculating the graph in my head","1 lists 1. search for \"unsubscribe in:inbox\" 2a. set a filter for ones. skip the inbox,

the slides","i believe also collaborated with google on a comic about browsers","for your talk! great breakdown of the pros/cons of perf techniques different frameworks use","ah that's right, i was going to ping on friday if it happened. guilt alleviated","i also gave it at react europe and that video is up","yeah, i'm considering doing that for next year's react conf","yes, i gave it today (and also at react europe). i'm also drafting a article based on it","vr is for sure gonna be a killer feature for web console... for those times when your errors just aren't real enough","wait, what c++ are you writing for react?","evenings after work or during builds because my attention is already scattered anyways","pool hall hostess floral assistant senate intern campus tour guide smithsonian

i'll probably be doing a code cartoon series on webpack starting in sept","i need to check this out. pretty sure next code cartoon is webpack, but might do css (& specifically aphrodite) after","that also looks awesome except the description keeps mentioning how cold the water is. not a good marketing tactic","same. code cartoons is an effort to help people see thru bullshitters who rely on the fact that no one will ? them b/c privilege","yes and she's very pleased to see the work is so appreciated","i appreciate the thought but i don't think my mom wants the attention","unfortunately she

5years ago","this is why we need a teleportation device","no, my mom was one of the programmers on the team","there are still conspiracy theorists in my mentions saying that they'll soon prove that you can't land on the moon with that code","when i asked she said she didn't remember enough about the code, which i can see since i can't remember code i wrote 5 yrs ago","yeah, it's such a weird feeling. i've known about this code for my whole life but never thought i'd see it","my mom isn't margaret hamilton, but she was a programmer on the project","i just called my mom to ask her and she laughed and said she can't remember any of it","no, but she was a programmer on the project","also using the pomodoro technique plus a self-control app to make sure i didn't check email, twitter

basically be doing a version of your talk at react europe","do you have automated perf tests in your react app? would love to see how you're doing it","i'm jumping in here without much context, but if it'd be helpful to see a codemirror instance in a component, checkout graphiql","this is 100% happening","bob ross finds his way back after getting lost for a few months among the happy little trees","people say \"the dom is slow\" a lot. are there any good articles breaking down the technical reasons for why that is?","i don't work at npm anymore. i believe is watching that repo, though","i use a react based project called spectacle. has given me p much all the functionality-but-with-flexibility i need","then my tech conf pajama set could be complete","i don't remember if the
