if painful: use snaps or something else","aim to provide many tools so people can write effective tests. no right or wrong, many scenarios. don't go too wide or narrow.","i'm hoping through the separation work we are doing in jest you'll be able to reuse bits to run the same tests in the browser.","the react team is working on it.","don't ever be scared! share your code and people will help you improve :) there is nothing you can do wrong.","you can run it on the react tests, that should give a good performance profile. it's not slow but i'm sure there are slow parts.","happy to use it for jest if we are allowed to deprecate and bump to 15.0. :)","i need a browser shim for path/fs node.js modules that allow me to create a virtual fs. anything out there?","so babel-node won't work because it would only run on jest itself, not the sandboxed tests.","needs npm3 though!","npm install + npm run watch in the background and you should be good to go.","jest adds all the transforms, code coverage etc. out of the box with almost zero config. use the assertions you want.","i also want to build a new visual system by merging jest into electron. fun experiments ensue!","we need to get updated, real docs onto the jest website again!!","that's ok! i wish it wasn't about me at all and that we can focus on the code and the systems we build. nothing else matters.","the react team is working on it but they are really busy so it takes some time.","yeah, it sucks that people ship uncompiled stuff to npm. either transform everything (slow) or whitelist.","you are making me fail my tech talk.","deeply humbled by everyone adopting jest. thank you so much! worked really hard on it for a year. doing an internal tech talk today, scared.","we also load babel in each process.","we also didn't build with react in mind. but we have thousands of real tests as benchmark at fb.","i'd like to have a section on the website on how to easily migrate to jest from other test runners. cc","if you put css styles into js, you can snapshots your component with styles!","google keep is awesome but my reminders get copied into inbox etc. and when i delete them from one place, they aren't gone in the other.","you guys make me happy.","early on we were thinking of building \"react diffs for codemods\".","where is my componentwillreacteverbefast ?","phew, jest is finally worthy of 's stamp of approval.","there is a new bearwatch app that tracks bears.","i'm so happy that the hiking app gives me the option to stop or continue my hike at the end. what would i do without it?","my talk is titled \"painful javascript testing\".","brb the jest team is out this week preparing internal tech talks. we'll be back in full force next week :)","cc did this at facebook.","but the idea is not to require('jsdom') until it is used. it has 4-500ms require time overhead.","you can try `jest.mock('react-dom')` in your test.","you are requiring react-dom and react-test-renderer. you can only have one per test until react 15.4.","we ran into many escaping issues because snapshot file is just js. we might escape more than we need :(","is this a big problem for you with escaping quotes etc. or does it work well?","also scriptpreprocessor isn't needed. the blog post will work without any setup.","that looks great. wanna send a pr to add it to the getting started guide on the jest website? want to add more specific docs.","use inline requires (not import). can have two copies of react. one with test renderer, one react-dom.","with jest you can do: require react, react-test-renderer test jest.resetmodules require react, enzyme","the react team is still working on these apis. patience :)","what were the discussions at reactreally, though? :d","we need to build a codemod.","yeah sinon is cool. what's missing from chai though? happy to adopt the same stuff, not the crazy stuff though :p","or encourage authors to ship both sources and build. use build files in dev; use sources for advanced compilation.","we could make the default be minified at a higher level (es6 etc.) and then only apply subset of transforms.","it's the plan to default packager to not compile node modules. and i are thinking about it.","we should also precompile rn itself and make node_modules be precompiled so that packager doesn't always have to compile everything.","actually i recommend all the blog posts we wrote on the jest website this year. they highlight everything really well.","whatever works for you. some things need browser testing but i recommend abstracting so you don't for most things.","there is loss of other stuff. we do static analysis, transforms, coverage etc. requires node apis","most code people write doesn't need to be tested in a browser. other tools should be used for that :)","node --inspect should allow that in node 6 (or 7?). no browser runner.","jest works for anything. just a unit test framework with good integration for react(-native).","even shorter: `npm install jest`.","we don't want to break users that much. was also thinking of defineproperty(global, 'window', {get: () => jsdom})","i didn't think it was necessary to break them. most people build websites, not services.","i think most people still use jsdom. it's ok as a default, easy to opt-out from to get 500ms faster startup.","enzyme is something that renders react components. jest is a test framework. use both together.","nuclide is written in java script!","i'm interested in building a next generation visual testing tool with jest as a base.","alternatively, come to our company!","you can use whatever you want at fb, no one forces you to use any tool :)","unfortunately we don't have that yet. help us build it? :)","expressed some interest making other browsers work. it's a huge project though and would take long.","can also use ts-jest from npm but that's experimental. has source map support i think.","yeah it works! you just need a custom ts preprocessor. see the examples/typescript folder on github","jest ships with jsdom by default but doesn't provide browser testing. use jest for unit tests and selenium etc. for end-to-end tests","hey ruben! excited to hear you are speaking about snapshot tests at reactnl. do you have some time to chat about this? :)","we can also snapshot react elements now, i guess :o","happy with a more condensed summary. if you do `coveragereporters: ['json']` we only print small text summary on cli.","didn't plan and only realized our monorepo approach with lerna naturally allowed for this to happen. thanks","just realized that `npm install jest-matchers` and `const {expect} = require('jest-matchers')` should work in other frameworks like mocha.","haha, if you think my code is great, you have never seen real code before! :p","happy to change it. give me a new sentence! :)","probably the first run without a cache. static analysis, load babel (1s), transform all files, load jsdom (500ms).","people at fb use `jest -o` automatically before creating a pr. it's rare for js test failures to make it to review.","so it depends on how broken your code is. can be between 1 minute and 20 minutes or so.","builds, tests, lints, everything. we run tens of thousands of different tests in any language for every change.","like when you refactor components you don't want to spend more time rewriting a test. just update a snapshot","and we need a component based selector api for snapshots, then we don't need enzyme as much any more.","no reason that it can't do something other than limited resources or we didn't yet need it at fb. help us make it your perfect testing tool.","there is a config guide for webpack compatible settings.","use `--no-cache` while working on .babelrc. we don't currently wipe away the cache when you do that (wanna help with a pr?).","you can also build your own assertion/test library that jest can use. happy to accept prs.","test renderer may not solve all needs yet (selection api missing) but you can use both or either","oh! jest can give you json results that you can process any way you like.","anything that you are missing from chai, we are happy to add it if its good.","you mean chai, right? mocha is a test runner, chai an assertion library.","yeah... right now it is all spaghetti code because i didn't have time to make it pretty :)","sooo.. my next question is how do i write automated tests for an interactive cli tool? :o","yeah. in london but we can always say it's september 1st in japan.","no, i just wanted to catch up to react because i hear higher numbers means we have done more work.","just git clone and npm install should work.","wait, i thought today was september 1st. i wanted to release today and embedded dates in source code. what do i do now?","try using `npm install jest@test`","wait, are you telling me javascript moved the furniture in the room? or did you build furniture to move furniture?","made this codemod really solid and it worked well for us at fb.","any strong js engineers available for contract work in austria? asking for a friend, message me :) please rt.","if we make bigger breaking changes we will always provide codemods :) we have thousands of tests at fb.","anyone interested in writing a chai to jasmine expect codemod? should be straightforward and very helpful to people migrating to jest.","write a codemod :)","thanks! we are happy to help - what would help you make the transition?","also rewritten coverage support; performance; buffered console logs; verbose by default for single test; better react-native support","we are using it at facebook.","that's nice! we should speed up npm though.","why not? should be in your face. send me an alternative idea!","we'll incrementally replace it. it's slowing development down, not jest itself.","happy to support a typescript-jest package based on example preprocessor if you want to send a pr.","has always been there! can use jest with any compile-to-js language as long as you have a preprocessor","one working on react, the other on jest. we should merge the projects, really.","transformative change happened since joined the jest team. excited for the next six months! stay tuned! =)","sure. probably just requires to mock react-dom.","yeah, mirror api and add new api that's better, basically. it has to be incremental.","we probably won't make it configurable but happy to accept prs.","it's why i think snapshot testing is so useful. write a test this simple, lock in the component and know when it changes","yes. it's not very optimized right now. we are planning to rewrite watch.","jest literally has its own transform cache if you use babel. why do you need anything else?","then you discovered my h2 plans and you have to come work at facebook and help us make it happen. i want this, yes!!","i'm curious about your data. please share! happy to help optimize.","you could try to integrate but jest needs preprocessing to happen synchronously during require time.","happy to help get started.","welcome to facebook.","jest is mostly adopted by companies rather than os library devs. want to get an idea of who uses it and what we can do to support you better","probably there until september 4th. but unconfirmed, will probably know towards the end of this week.","oh man, i'm gonna be in london august 15 to 19 and possibly also early september. is this event also happening then?","i didn't think it was rage and appreciated that i was pushed to share my views.","i'm always happy to help contributors on anything!","and i'm also happy to look into any issues, but prs are definitely more welcome if you want it to get done sooner :)","there is a testregex option that you can set to anything. we'll change configs to globs soon, to make it approachable.","we now use a babel plugin for injecting the coverage variables. are you using a custom preprocessor? if yes, you can instrument there.","is it a problem if babel-jest is installed?","this is really a node problem that i can't do much about. happy to help debug if you show me a repo with a repro.","switch to jest today. it's an easy switch and we are happy to help. loads of benefits!","is there a babel plugin for this yet?","either! jest forwards to jest-cli. we only recently got that npm name :)","we are also hoping to expand the test render api a bit","these will be fixed in the next react release. they shouldn't matter.","yeah! we'd like to do it but gent gotten around to it. probably a nice react pr if you wanna do it.","it's a standalone package and we are happy to accept prs that make it more generic to integrate into others. or.. use jest? :)","no! i'm still strapped to my basement chair at facebook. get me out of here please.","this allows to swap out any component you don't care about. you can render arbitrarily deep or shallow with jest.mock().","thanks to and for building it! i'm excited for all the things we have planned for improving this feature","are there any react native open source projects i can use to try the experimental react native jest preset?","oh, also, this allows us to use react-native without mocks :)","every facebook project has to be performant by default. if it's not, there is no point in building it."]
