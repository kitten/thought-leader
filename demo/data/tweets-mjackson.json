calendar etc","im personally going non-apple in 2017 been far too long since i gave the competition a serious shake","even if its not called react will be on the cutting edge of software development for the foreseeable future","i generate files for the browser at build time and publish them to npm but dont commit them they can be served with","react itself took that strategy soon after it was open sourced","fwiw i always use node_env same as react so anyone bundling it already does it","ya genius shuffle on your existing library is awesome would be great for discovery too","genius shuffle for all of apple music given music thats already in my library play stuff you think ill like would be so killer","ill give it a shot just have a hard time trusting native js fns given past experience w differing results","heads up to anyone whos worried about react router api churn v4 is still alpha and were working on smooth upgrade path dont fret","stopped by facebooks vr booth in bryant park nyc the other day first vr experience very cool","stay humble stay relevant otherwise technology will move right along and youll be left in the dust angrily shaking your fists","totally its so common that many editor plugins have been developed solely for find and rename in scope","the more code i write the more anxious i get about wrapping up chunks of it into neat little abstractions early on to keep back the tide","this is also why building large apps is more difficult than building small ones because the tendency to abstract prematurely is greater","in other words the more easily you can refactor your code without breaking stuff the quicker you can arrive at the right abstraction","this is why having tools that are easily composed and rearranged is critical because hitting on the right abstraction requires refactoring","indeed i was looking for elf on apple music","including the command center that held the nuclear launch codes","programming is figuring out the right abstraction over and over again","good thing you guys will have a killer opportunity to fix this in facebooks new phone next year","ah now i remember why ive always avoided wireless keyboards","lots of major players giving it their support hope it works well for polymer devs too","afaict the uptake for has been pretty widespread for most of the npm community","thanks for the tip is yarn working out for polymer devs or still using bower","i think polymer is the only community that really depends on bower is that right can polymer devs use yarn with npm instead","so stylescss was showing in the directory listing but when you requested it directly it wasnt there huh odd","glad to hear it and very happy to hear you found it too boo for tired shaky hands","plus theres already a great toolchain for compiling straight to machine code it really seems positioned well imo","have you looked at the debugging story in ocaml is pretty amazing and bucklescript compiles to js","you dont even have to build this from scratch you could just build something on top of others apis","careful might set it on fire with how many tests facebook runs each day","business opportunity in the tech space a fully-integrated ci environment with real browser testing capabilities eg travis browserstack","or maybe they start with a new class of devices entirely like amazon did with the kindle","need to get a toehold somehow like build a cool little watch or a phone or something even that is a huge task","yep its going to be already kind of is google their phoneslaptops are going to be crazy good in a few years","awesome yes id be happy to as well id like to understand the constraints youre working with","btw my intention was to have a createnativehistory function that does the same on react native","enjoying using my new microsoft sculpt today going to take a little time to get used to but i think my wrists will be happier","just opted-out of github email notifications not sure why i didnt do that years ago only web notifications now","ah you know the magic css incantations forget react thats priceless","well no worries im seriously happy i was able to help you though you dont owe me anything just pass it on","thanks i appreciate your intention","im going to use it as the name of my next js framework","ya i hadnt either until last week decided to give apple music a try which btw is great","yep agree mac desktop apps have come a long ways but there are still a few noticeable outliers","meanwhile photoshop is freaking out at my new 4k display and slowing down to the point of becoming unusable ah technology","theres another approach","react makes the problem more complex bc you dont know what youre rendering until","theres no reason why generating html markup needs to be async","the intersection of people who are really good at web and mobile is really really small nobody knows what theyre saying","id love to read more about this anything online that describes your approach in detail","what about a small subset of js ala asmjs","as long as i can use straight-up javascript expressions inside my then im good","ya i think youre right i realize im not smart enough to optimize my jsx as much as a compiler could a template","and if using jsx allows me to avoid that then i guess ill use it for now","agree im not a huge fan of jsx i am a huge fan of not writing my own programming language though","or even angular pages upon pages of docs just so you can learn the custom programming language they invented for you","eventually people are going to come along with requirements that would be easy to solve if you were just using javascript","contrast with jsx or even ejs where you use real javascript in your templates you dont have to re-invent lang constructs","heck i wrote mustachejs and i have to go look up the docs that i wrote in order to use it","this is a huge obstacle for users who cant remember how to do stuff the mustache way so they have to go look up the docs","mustache essentially re-invents a lot of stuff that javascript already gives you loops conditionals variables etc","so eg if you look at the mustachejs project or even the svelte guides you see a bunch of docs about mustache syntax","ya mustaches are a pretty big downer but the idea of building components as html files scoped styles","but i definitely appreciate s perspective here would be a great exercise to invert the mental model","its also very straightforward to read and follow so lots of benefits but my programmer spidey senses are tingling","actually in the end i think duplicating code here will ultimately lead to the smallest bundle size too","ha neither do i especially since in this library youll only ever require one of those files so i think its ok","im basically looking for a more elegant way to do that share the lthistoryprovidergt code between those 3 components wout another component","thats a higher-order component and yes itll add that component to the hierarchy when you use it","im trying to avoid using hocs in your example hocomponent adds another layer to the hierarchy","no no significant problems just large component trees when viewing with react devtools and maybe perf","im looking for a method to essentially mix in behavior into an existing react component class instead of composing","usually to get some behavior or ui in react i make a new component and compose it w others to create stuff","ah sorry by in your react components i meant add lifecycle methods","how do you share code between your react components without introducing more components into the hierarchy you cant say mixins p","ha no way im currently working on react router v4 its a dig on myself as much as anything","ya thats perfect i remember discussing this same idea with react core contribs at the original react conf","so 0x gives us the flexibility to nail down the api and 10 is more of a long-term commitment","i think ideally the jump to 10 will just be a change to packagejson version no code changes","trump promised to let me buy out of state health insurance if it happens may at least give me a few options","just make sure youre testing what the component actually renders and youll be alright dont test propsstate","in ca the only alternative is to just pay out of pocket for everything and pray nothing bad happens","fwiw ive had the same experience as someone who primarily does dev","weve heard this request many times but ltlink componentgt isnt the answer","i think ltlinkgt isnt what you think it is what component are you trying to substitute","in dev i completely agree with you i hate developing on a train or a plane or something with network dependencies","ya i guess we are essentially questioning that assumption at least as far as serving your app in production goes","youre wrong i love web components what are you even saying did you say something bad about them i dont know","so now instead of everyone loading jquery from their own domains we all use the exact same copy from google which is cached","agree this was the original reason that google put up jquery on their cdn back in the day because everyone was using it","once you hit critical mass some interesting things start to happen that could make this possible","imagine for a second if we had a globally-shared node_modules dir and once you downloaded a package you never had to again","no its not terribly odd ive done quite a bit of devops i understand where youre coming from","in other words your entire app could crash right now and you wouldnt be able to do anything about it","thanks jared it was a pleasure meeting you happy to help you guys get react into your stack too","thats exactly the assumption that im questioning i think a partial server render client render is actually faster better ux","indeed id personally love to hear more talks from people like who are experimenting w hybrid apps in 2g markets","yes i think a hybrid approach makes a lot of sense if you can afford the eng hours","and saying stuff like you need ssr for 2g users ignores a lot of possibilities for even better ux w a hybrid approach","even on slow connections and low power devices it doesnt seem like ssr is the answer to your perf problems","i want a completely separate site that i can give to the crawlers so i dont have to mix those concerns w the rest of my app","afaict literally the only thing server rendering is good for these days is seo on search engines that are not google thats it","for so many people this is like the thing that brings them to react but its so much more trouble than its really worth","people think its more important than it is support it is more trouble than its worth it makes your app harder to grok etc","im using the web version i didnt know they had a previous one just started a month ago","i believe was completely designed and built by crazy talented people","this lets you easily just dump a bunch of apps in a directory and go im going to be using this all over the place","yes i believe we still have sooo far to go when it comes to ui design","sure could do that as well just following the lead of react core __","think about it like react-addons you wouldnt just name something that if you werent official","just like react core im sure polymer core has to try and sell people on using their tech internally","i think some of s talk was probably directed at google internally","eg when the condition is falsy your ltifgt component just discards thispropschildren which could potentially be large","the problem is that when the condition is falsy youre just building up a bunch of vdom elements and throwing them away","yep ive built a few components like that in the past i try to avoid the if type components nowadays though","any good links also i suppose the nation splitting led to the code splitting discussion","thats insane never thought id see the day when react was more popular than angular","i put a lot of ternaries inline in my jsx branches that i dont take dont ever execute","i know ive built many apis done lots and lots of normalizing in my work","still addons-controlled is just a react component feel free to dig in and work it","i mean its a pretty safe bet to use a dep that is so small like addons-routes v4 is just components","eg the definition of web page changes from site to site seems like we need a different primitive maybe its a bundle","just to clarify im not talking about putting all my app state in redux just application lifecycle stuff boot load data session etc","i dont mean keep everything in redux just app lifecycle stuff","current status investigating using redux to manage the entire application lifecycle anyone else doing this","its funny though the react docs are so littered with deprecation warnings these days it discourages experimentation","me too google is working on a new laptop cant wait to see it","i blame jsx it really breaks down in that style of composition","hey thanks i really appreciate that","in college i was the only kid with a mac now i wanna be the only dev without one","i wanna kick my apple habit so bad just cant find good alternatives","people ask me all the time how they can better learn javascript and i have no clue where to send them","in other words its a javascript thing","were also following the lead of create-react-app in all our material so instance prop initializers are fair game thank goodness","yep this is one that i learned from the interview with the stripe founders cant remember if it was john or patrick","sometimes tech founders have the tendency to want to hide their mistakes at yc every time you talked to someone they were killing it","id totally agree with that 99 of the time every once in a while someone gets rich inventing cool tech","that sounds totally obvious but people do it all the time if you cant get anyone genuinely excited about what youre building just stop","if youre not making and many tech startups dont its easy for minor disagreements to escalate and destroy the company","do you know of any other toolchain that lets you do that maybe clojurescript","i miss the days when i got to decide how to write my own code","thats in react too right","i should probably just stop writing js too and move to","i think i should embrace this new dark side of me michael jackson bad guy of javascript","yep thats what i was thinking too unfortunately the babel parser already forces us to have all imports in the root scope","whats the largest file in the npm registry any guesses","ya weve already got the node_env checks im wondering if theres a way to exclude the module from the build entirely","does envify remove dead imports from the build if you import using es6 modules and then dont use it","im talking about the import not the actual componentproptypes how do you tell webpack to not actually import the file","and to me it feels very much like stitching together react components i think we still have a ways to go but its a start","so eg i can say this config represents an app server i need 10 of them and run them all behind this load balancer","you can compose an ansible config just like you compose react components by importing some code and injecting it somewhere","react component props are your protocol for communicating between systems like thrift or protobufs are for your backend","no i havent used them enough but i know docker and kubernetes are very popular","react components are systems in and of themselves you can compose them to build larger systems","linux containers are the react components of the devops world composable reproducable and isolated","no base classes no component local state there are other ways you can get it","i wonder if anyone has written about infra fatigue yet docker kubernetes ansible puppet the list goes on and on so much cool stuff","im diving back into infrastructure-land tonight and reminded what it must feel like for them to dive into web programming in 2016","oh wait re-reading through that article it seems s web_concurrency env var is just an avail memory allocation","at the heart the app is really simple grab a tgz from the npm registry and serve the files inside it done","we used to be the default in the quick add section but it looks like they reverted back to cdnjs","i had no idea and i thought read the entire website on day one was the site recently updated to show that stuff","on the one hand i really admire for pushing the limits of the web on the other it all just seems totally impractical","i think before react i wouldve said appendchild was an inherently imperative operation like other dom manipulations","eg i can imagine a ruby or python dev being annoyed they have to install node to manage deps","this is ofc not a technical limitation but something that will likely bother devs in other non-js ecosystems","seems like the major barrier to adoption in other ecosystems would be the fact that yarn requires node to run right","im not sure i follow yarn is more than an npm i replacement please say more","absolutely deleting code is so satisfying","just imagine if programming were more like golf and the smallest apis with the fewest number of lines were always the winners","if we wish to count lines of code we should not regard them as lines produced but as lines spent another gem","working with the service worker api sure makes me glad i took time to thoroughly learn and use promises its full of them","im saying i have a hunch we can do better than react-redux provide the same benefits with less indirection maybe not","i agree but i also think its possible we can find more obvious ways to connect redux to react","yes react-redux removes a lot of the boilerplate but the jump from setstatestate gt dispatchconnect is a big one conceptually speaking","then after we get a chance to talk about higher-order components and context introduce connect and ltprovidergt","im thinking itll be a lot easier to teach redux wout react-redux introduce a few concepts at a time starting with the store setstate","ive been playing around with service worker and offline-first apps a lot recently and s course is top-notch","internet randos are the best hey have you heard about react its awesome","i was working on the same thing in mootools at the time and extjs was an order of magnitude faster by inlining everything","reminds me of the old extjs version of what became queryselectorall that compiled queries to a flat function and it was fast","agree you either have to be a core dev or talk to them a lot just to know what to write","good docs are harder than good code sometimes ive just done readmes for my last few projects","by my count has now made very significant contributions to 3 package managers what a champ","honestly i havent used the new router enough yet to know it just feels like you should only need components","its great for demos and other kinds of sites where you dont havewant a build process","if thats someones first exposure to react components it makes it harder for them to understand how powerful they can be imo","yes i think thats right putting too much emphasis on components-for-presentation can inhibit understanding i think","whats the best resource for getting started using redux in a real app asking for a friend","in other words if you can write react components you can add the features you need to react router v4","also is showing us how its easier to start contributing to the router than ever before its just components now","huge congrats brian facebook is lucky to have you","i really appreciate how you articulated the issues talking about specific issues is gt hand-wavy web v native arguments","the new google hardware is impressive cant wait to see the new laptop theyre working on","or is it because these people honestly feel trapped like they dont know how to contribute and affect the change they want to see","i think tech leads have an important job middle managers are mostly email jockies","i think thats the right approach get the api right first then optimize","its a readability thing i can read constlet and immediately know programmers original intent","only until fri evening doing a quick workshop at uber but we can prob still find some time","i basically want a high-level oss database i can use from the browser w a hosted solution as well","wait you mean i cant just instantly be a web developer anymore","we tend to use the idea of a component to mean encapsulation like a tiny system as opposed to a dumb template","before reacts component model i didnt really have a system that let me do this","the key i think is having a model that enables you to build lots of little apps and put them together in an organized way","ha thats the same thing i say to people all the time who ask how do i write a large app in react you dont","i think et al were hesitant to add routing to create-react-app until they were sure there was something good to use","turns out routing is actually a difficult problem to solve on the client much more difficult than we anticipated","i dont think weve ever intentionally supported ie8 whats the last version of react that does","i for one am seriously relieved react came on the scene when it did otherwise wed be using web components","its all about finding the right abstraction first i dont think anyone had it right before react","but ya i remember vividly the feeling of wtf why is it so hard to make a website nowadays the landscape changes quickly","thing i miss most in my non-babel js code using the stuff spread operator never realized how much i use it","just some old outdated code please ignore","so my fans are blazing and cpu is pegged apparently because of icloud contact syncing which i dont use","the best personal finance app is","best personal money tracker and budgeting tool currently trying to answer the question where the heck is all my going","the site is a cdn for npm packages we serve about 100m requests a day growing like crazy right now","i think the cyclejs router uses it id love for the ember amp angular crowds to take a look","happy to add you as a collaborator if youd like","ltdownloadtwentygigsofdatarighthereinthebrowserandmakeanicechartformekthanksbyegt","president giving a message ive been thinking about a lot lately remember who you are and where you come from","i know that really helps me and when were talking about code","it would be awesome if we had a way to all share a screen together and write some code","like design follow","i use callbacks all the time but i still havent figured out a clean alternative for promiseall in callback-land","agree im hoping i never have to write promise code again after asyncawait","if you never took the time to learn how to use promises in javascript i have a feeling youre going to hate asyncawait","is that also known as the components are not actually very useful tower","some days i think i shouldve been an angular developer","ya its silly i decided not to use slack bc of stuff like this now apple is incorporating it into messages","is it possible to disable rich url previews in messages conversations in macos sierra my google-fu is failing me","even if we were perfect at optimizing least number of upset people that number will never be 0 shipit","alright guess wed better ship react router v4 final asap looks like people are already using our little preview in production","haha i remember that too boston last nov i put up an html page right before my flight took off","i know the redux devs got their ideas from elm among other places not sure about om but they do time travel etc","ah makes sense redux is the major catalyst for this idea in my experience emphasizes pure stateless components","agree im already compiling w webpack targetnode and its a pain no fun","commonjs has that same problem right","right now im writing es6 modules for front-end code commonjs on node its kind of messy though","like the theory sounds nice we should be able to only import pieces of code from modules etc but is it practical","mmm ya i think thats kind of what were after with the ltmatchgt component even has the same name","ha i remember undefined args really threw me for a loop going from ruby to js theyre treated differently","separation of concerns blinds a lot of us to the brilliance of react i get that question regularly in workshops","because javascript doesnt have pattern matching haha jk please say more what do you mean","i think thats an incredibly healthy way to live not to feel bad about it just to recognize that it happens frequently","i do the same thing all the time have to actually write some code before i can see the limitations of things","ha i remember a talk where he joked nobody cares what theyre building as long as they get to use cool tech","whenever i see tabs on github im like man i cant use this code screw that guy","so many of us think about optimizing stuff before we have any clue how to measure if its even slow","ah me too not exaggerating i get the performance in react question in every workshop on the 1st day","maybe if well-known programmers talk about times they were wrong it can help others realize its ok we all still have stuff to learn","but i had no idea about vdom or any of the other stuff that makes react cool so took me a while to get that","so i was already prepped i had felt the pain of writing my own programming language firsthand and didnt like it","im really not trying to brag but jsx was the appealing part to me i had spent the past year rewriting mustachejs","oh snap you had to dig deep to find that tweet thanks man appreciate it","ha join the club i think just about everyone was wrong about react when they first saw it","haha programming can be such a macho endeavor highly competitive i wanna explore the vulnerable side","wow i missed that one huge respect for writing that piece babel 6 gave me a few wtf moments as well","as programmers we tend to talk about solutions we like to show others how smart we are id love to hear about times you werent","as a computer programmer what are some things that youve been wrong about was it because of ignorance or unwillingness to learn","hey thanks for sharing the high-level api could use some polish but all the pieces for great composition are there i think","it doesnt look like i can buy a replacement cable for my apple thunderbolt display anywhere is that correct how sad","hey youre welcome id love to hear if you run into any snags i think the high-level api can still improve a lot","in all seriousness if youre really good at coming up with decisive names and not changing your mind later youd be a great programmer","in a traditional stack push means put something on the stack pop means take something off not so w browser history stacks","hey thats compound components d nicely done i like your api composes well","ya go for it theres lots of stuff in there in general i dont try to do too much just the basics let others build on top","its a madhouse thats why i always kind of smirk when people talk about web standards browsers to agree on stuff but fail","yep it gets even harrier after you dig deeper browsers behave differently based on what features you need","windowaddeventlistenerpopstate event gt consoleloggo nuts","requirehistorycreatebrowserhistorylistenlocation gt consoleloglocation","they allow you to easily wrap up common pieces of functionality in these little boxes that you put together later composable http clients","but they didnt like the idea so i thought i guess i have to build this myself","i actually approached the operator of other cdn before i wrote any code for unpkg hoping we could work together","and when redux users show up and complain that stuff is slow we can tell them just use redux not react-redux","in that case lets just monkey patch react-redux in react-router-redux and be done w it","seems like abuse for any library to return false if they cant make that guarantee","in my experience more api usually just makes things worse","instead were now considering slapping more api on to react because someone is misusing the escape hatch","so react redux needs to figure out a different way to be fast wout using scu that would fix this","if youre going to use scu you better be 100 sure your children dont need those updates react redux is not"]
