happen. 4-0, no problem.","and i have been loving . it's more of a budgeting tool though, less of a tracker.","overload import, like webpack does?","afaict typescript is where it's at","you can trace

my sub for messaging/video chat on android. get a google pixel and free google photos for life.","which plugins do you use? so far i only have vim-mode-plus and language-babel","no. it has a very specific use case and reason for existing. without it, react would be crippled.","also really interesting to note that htmlelement is not available in v8 snapshots. not good for custom elements.","tbh

chris very happy to hear that. what are you working on?","i think of my components like i think about functions. how much is too much code for a single function?","ya, me too ... and i wrote the code ... :/","what about js frameworks? those are dev tools, right?","\"ooooooh, i didn't have *types* ... so *that's* why my javascript wasn't scaling!\"","this is as if react assumed shouldcomponentupdate = false always. interesting design decision!","interesting that they say the imperative api has not aged well. the rendering engine used to be written in react iirc.","i was going to ask the same thing. if they're designing interactions and pairing with engineers, 1:5 seems a little heavy.","every time i try i end up feeling like i'm doing the majority of the work and i'm

\"actions\" panel in the demo gif","agree. the documentation use case is one that is not addressed at all in react anymore w/out deprecation warnings","if e.g. babel were to step up and use a similar

expects?","honestly, for me it's a form of runnable documentation. i can look at your proptypes and instantly know how to use your component.","yep, me too. pretty sure there has to be something better than apple's airport extreme out there, but i've been out of the loop.","if you had to build a 3k sq ft home wireless network from scratch, how would you do it? what gear would you

those kinds of comments can have.","the react world can be challenging to work in, but i think the the freedom of choice will ultimately be a strength for everyone","ya, you nailed it. i'm envious of what you're able to do with a smaller ecosystem. you control all the variables.","that would be so killer. it's something the react community has had a really hard time standardizing on.","i want the search results to be urls that people can put in a script tag. slightly different than a standard npm search.","i dare you to clone the cdnjs repo and try to check out a new branch... ;)","i think we'll get there, eventually. webpack feels like a stepping stone.","personally, i'm upset we're calling webmasters \"web developers\" ... how'd that happen?!","where can i learn more about html modules? first i've heard of them.","i still get a kick out of building components that manage all their own state like that. encapsulation! so cool","whaaaaaa?! that's awesome! let me know how it goes! also, happy to stop by and do some tutoring and play zelda","at that time, i was working on a complex app and trying to manage a lot of complexity in the client. react was like a ray of

\"this could be simpler\"","is rp's stylesheet cross-platform? or is the intent to provide the rn api to web and use rn's stylesheet on native?","also, build step on the server feels icky, like java","are you using stylesheet.create on any web projects? i'm coming around to your opinion that it's a pretty great api.","not that i know of. i'm just thinking about it. was setting up a node app the other day and used commonjs. felt great.","maybe use `browser: { \"the/module\": false }` ?","(and even though i use es modules in my client-side code, it still compiles down to commonjs via webpack, so...)","welp, looks like i'm using commonjs on node from here on out. it's the simplest thing and it always just works.","how did make it easier to build this app?","can i just say how happy it makes me that you used var and createclass","love this, yes. i love how react neatly solves one piece of the puzzle w a simple api. i want to emphasize this in my work.","i love how react solves context issues by just avoiding the whole concept entirely. just use the vars in javascript scope!","do you remember any specific problems that react solved better than your backbone stack? was it just bugs in your renders?","do you remember the moment when you first got really excited about ? what were you working on?","there is no easy way to delete duplicate photos in apple photos. mind blown.","turns out it wasn't actually a package manager, just a downloader/installer with a publish function. weird.","i was like \"you want to build a package manager? do you know how much work that is?!\"","webpack is the only one you need.","i will try to remember, yes or, you can follow for updates about this and other courses we're working on.","we've got an intro video on the website, but i'm working on a much more extensive video course this week.","but overall the codebase of rrv4 is more stable and mature than ever. and has served many people well.","fwiw the react core team has told us they feel like the project is going in the right direction","i'd be happy to hop on a screen share if you've got specific questions about how to use it.","we built react-router in 2014, then everyone went on christmas break and finally got a chance to play w it","advanced users don't use javascript","it's the thing that makes components so powerful. they can hold their own state, just like dom elements do!","it's the very first thing i teach to someone learning react. the ability for a component to have its own state is key!","guess i'm not \"advanced\" enough. i think it's one of the most important pieces of the react component model.","you probably need to use some opengraph meta tags in your html <head>","... which was not fun. but the idea that something higher-level than just the source code could exist stuck with me.","i think flow-based is one idea, ya. i remember being in school and the professors made me do a few assignments in uml","because every time i sit down to bang out some code these days i'm like \"ugh, really??\"","i think maybe i crossed some magical \"1 million lines of code\" barrier recently or something","when i was in school in the late 2000s i remember the professors describing stuff using uml. didn't look very fun either","i believe you. i'd like to try it out, just to see what it's like. unfortunately, i didn't really start programming until 2008","tools that are able to operate on an ast instead of source code are going to become increasingly important, imo. formatters, linters, mods.","getting so tired of writing \"source code\".

time","<pre>{json.stringify(this.state, null, 2)}</pre>","thanks, adam! that native stuff was for you!","xhtml forever scarred us into auto-closing stuff that looks like xml (jsx).","ya, i think so. everything else i use is google.","not familiar with side loading. is that rolling back to an older version of the app?","it's seriously embarrassing how bad facebook is at guessing who and what is important to me. that should be their whole job.","now i see a bunch of random people at the very top, front and center when i open the app. great work, everyone. you suck.","dang. just when i had settled on fb messenger as my main messaging app, they go and add the \"my day\" feature which i can't disable.","maybe twitter can monetize a subscription model for male nerd ego battles.","sure!

\"yes\", how many approved of ?","thank you :) i sincerely appreciate the kind words. best of luck with your own training workshops!","but we've already had some really positive feedback about rrv4 on native and have built some really interesting stuff.","it seems like it should be possible today with all the js tooling available. wish i were better at programming vim..","no source maps. imagine everything formatted the same on disk, but you can see and manipulate the code however you want.","even with all the js tooling we have available today? what's the hard part? i imagine it would be the editor","wanted: a way to see a different version of code in vim than what's saved on disk, formatted to my prefs.","dress your code, dude","and it just strikes me as a little odd that companies of that size are building their backends in node now","ah, nope. i've had a few convos with people lately who are like \"all the enterprise java stacks are moving to javascript\"","are they the amazon premium ones? i bought those a few weeks ago and have been very happy with them.","you would be rendering entire component trees and then just throwing them away","it's not about cost. i just don't trust tv makers to make non-technical software.","google hangouts video chats don't work they never do they are a lie just so you know kthxbye","ya, they do all the time. npm just isn't well-suited to installing stuff that needs a compile step.","interesting. do you write much code? been pondering making the switch, just unsure what it's like for a dev.","for the past few years i've been recommending people who want cutting edge stuff to git clone + npm link. it's more robust.","modern js dev workflows with compile step make it difficult to install straight from git repos these days anyway.","developers are the most critical, hard-to-please kind of people. they're always unimpressed, no matter how much you give.","that would be great basically, i just need to know how many steps to move in the history stack in response to dev tools change","if we can get this to work, it will finally answer the question of how to integrate react router with redux dev tools","that's just apple trying to make feel dirty. it's like five guys making you order a \"little\" burger.","back to dating? what happened to ?","anyone know why a react.children.map + array.foreach would not behave the same as a react.children.foreach? i'm stumped.","vim webpack.config.js","agree. it gets easier for me to spin up a new webpack config the more i use it. i do it all the time now","i think when you can take a codebase and run it in a foreign environment than the one it was designed for, that's a good test","i've been very pleased with how well we've been able to start experiencing with the router on native, for example.","the router only cares about the ui piece, same as react. \"react router\" we expose all our state on history for other stuff","that's the way i use it, anyway. for me it'd be harder to work on a codebase that didn't do that","whenever i read \"let\" in js code, i immediately understand that somewhere it gets reassigned","when you say \"we've struggled with routing\" are you talking about react-router? or more general than that?","react fixes a lot of dom events across browsers. eg onchange.","also, just wondering about events. am i correct in assuming that preact does nothing special with event handling?","i seriously have no idea how people write (p)react code w/out proptypes. that's my documentation!","or are they only supported in preact-compat?","seriously thinking again about just turning them off. if you've got a problem, fork away. it's your code too.","it's a total edge case, but a refactoring that makes the code more pluggable could be good for it.","oh, that tweet wasn't directed at you. i'm happy to answer questions like yours.","github issues: free support for my free code.","side note: with upcoming <script type=module> support no npm i will be needed","u just use the url for the package followed by a / to see what's in it","i often use to make sure i'm not shipping any useless stuff to npm","i love it when tiny changes like that

do that with urls you need json","yes. take a break for a few days as well and recharge. only check web ui for notifications, and use \"mark all as read\" liberally","so far google assistant has understood all my music requests except for \"play something by u2\"","that's impossible! you can't do that! react router v4 will not support any advanced use cases!!","nope, gotta use a google nexus or pixel","nope, google phones only. quick, take it back!","ya, i built a \"real app\" that consumed rest apis with redux. def made sense there.","it's designed to be \"not configurable\". just a few settings, and then you stop caring about how your code is formatted.","import { nativerouter } from 'react-router-native'","love it. i can just read that jsx and know exactly what's going on :)

browser?","thank you we're very happy you like it","in that case, is there a good polyfill we can recommend for older browsers?","the main problem with this is that redux (and maybe mobx, not sure) treat all state changes the same","ya, lots of people are hung up on it. imo knowing what to trim is as crucial as knowing what to keep in an api.","this is one of the major misconceptions behind using history + redux. i need to write something soon.","the \"browser history is updated\" square should be on the left by \"url changed\". they happen in sync","i have but it was like 2 years ago. i

cool!","... in react-router, for example. the packager had a hard time working outside the context of a rn app, the happy path","agree. also, ability to develop 3rd party libs in general. we've had a difficult time working with rn packager","props are my react spirit animal.","i mean, it was so terrible for so many years, but people still used it. that's indicative of a ton of trapped

more excited about the web version tho :)","so npm scopes are really just a way to multiply the namespace of the public registry, i think","pretty sure anyone could go ahead and publish a

fundamental problem but take a different approach","difference between webpack and systemjs seems to be that one is a bundler while the other is designed to require from the network","not sure. i think it's just es6 modules from here on out tho. both webpack and systemjs use them.","the loader api allows you to shim where you get the module from. so we just tell it to get the package from

switched it to javascript when i put rollup in the poll...","is there a list somewhere of all the events react currently has polyfills for?","after using both fairly extensively, i can't imagine not having webpack in my toolbelt now. it's invaluable.","i felt the exact same way when i first got into webpack i even fought my collaborators on it. i like it a lot now though.","i'd really appreciate it if fans of the other build tools could rt. i've seen a few already.","that's a vote for webpack ;)","people are doing crazy shenanigans w javascript these days! best to stick with lua ;)","true. i don't remember anyone doing anything with webpack until started advocating it.","i think maybe rollup just suffers from lack of widespread support. could be an awesome tool in the future.","isn't javascript just a rather complex tool for making the computer do what you want it to do?","hot reloading went mainstream when webpack made it pretty easy to do. i think browserify can do it now too. not sure tho.","gotcha. i haven't heard of anyone starting a new project using require.js recently, so i omitted it from the poll.","how do you bundle your javascript?","it's my job to think. if i can't devote my whole attention to something, i'm not nearly as valuable.","we're going to try to manage everything in the same repo, but publish separate packages for dom and native routing.","fyi, react router v4 will be split among a few packages so those who don't need e.g. dom stuff (native) won't have to install react-dom.","fwiw, the google pixel has some great hardware. biggest hurdle for

of jsx. i *am* a huge fan of not writing my own programming language though.","or even angular! pages upon pages of docs, just so you can learn the custom programming language they invented for you","eventually, people are going to come along with requirements that would be easy to solve if you were just using javascript","contrast with jsx (or even ejs!) where you use real javascript in your templates. you don't have to re-invent lang constructs!","heck, i *wrote* mustache.js and *i* have to go look up the docs *that i wrote* in order to use it","this is a huge obstacle for users who can't remember how to do stuff \"the mustache way\" so they have to go look up the docs","mustache essentially re-invents a lot of stuff that javascript already gives you: loops, conditionals, variables, etc.","so e.g., if you look at the mustache.js project (or even the svelte guides!) you see a bunch of docs about mustache syntax","ya, mustaches are a pretty big downer but the idea of building components as html files + scoped styles!","but i definitely appreciate 's perspective here. would be a great exercise to invert the mental model.","it's also very straightforward to read and follow. so lots of benefits. but my programmer spidey senses are tingling ;)","actually, in the end i think duplicating code here will ultimately lead to the smallest bundle size too.","ha, neither do i :) especially since in this library you'll only ever require *one* of those files. so i think it's ok.","i'm basically looking for a more elegant way to do that: share the <historyprovider> code

example, hocomponent adds another layer to the hierarchy","no, no significant problems. just large component trees when viewing with react devtools. and maybe perf.","i'm looking for a method to essentially \"mix in\" behavior into an existing react component class instead of composing","usually to get some behavior or ui in react i make a new component and compose it w others to create stuff","ah, sorry. by \"in your react components\" i meant \"add lifecycle methods\"...","how do you share code between your react components without introducing more components into the hierarchy? you can't say mixins! :p","ha, no way. i'm currently working on react router v4. it's a dig on myself as much as anything.","ya, that's perfect. i remember discussing this same idea with react core contribs at the original react conf.","so 0.x gives us the flexibility to nail down the api and 1.0 is more of a long-term commitment.","i think ideally the jump to 1.0 will just be a change to package.json version. no code changes.","trump promised to let me buy out of state health insurance. if it happens, may at least give me a few options.","just make sure you're testing what the component actually renders and you'll be alright. don't test props/state","in ca, the only alternative is to just pay out of pocket for everything and pray nothing bad happens.","fwiw i've had the same experience as someone who primarily does dev","we've heard this request many times. but <link component> isn't the answer.","i think <link> isn't what you think it is. what component are you trying to substitute?","in dev, i completely agree with you. i hate developing on a train or a plane or something with network dependencies.","ya, i guess we are essentially questioning that assumption, at least as far as serving your app in production goes.","youre wrong i love web components what are you even saying did you say something bad about them i don't know","so now, instead of everyone loading jquery from their own domains we all use the exact same copy from google, which is cached","agree. this was the original reason that google put up jquery on their cdn back in the day. because everyone was using it.","once you hit critical mass some interesting things start to happen that could make this possible.","imagine for a second if we had a globally-shared node_modules dir and once you downloaded a package you never had to again","no, it's not terribly odd i've done quite a bit of devops. i understand where you're coming from.","in other words, your entire app could crash right now and you wouldn't be able to do anything about it","thanks, jared :) it was a pleasure meeting you. happy to help you guys get react into your stack, too!","that's exactly the assumption that i'm questioning. i think a partial server render + client render is actually faster + better ux","indeed. i'd personally love to hear more talks from people like who are experimenting w hybrid apps in 2g markets","yes! i think a hybrid approach makes a lot of sense if you can afford the eng hours","and saying stuff like \"you need ssr for 2g users\" ignores a lot of possibilities for even better ux w a hybrid approach","even on slow connections and low power devices, it doesn't seem like ssr is the answer to your perf problems","i want a completely separate site that i can give to the crawlers so i don't have to mix those concerns w the rest of my app","afaict literally the *only* thing server rendering is good for these days is seo on search engines that are not google. that's it.","for so many people this is like, *the thing* that brings them to react. but it's so much more trouble than it's really worth.","people think it's more important than it is. support it is more trouble than it's worth. it makes your app harder to grok. etc.","i'm using the web version. i didn't know they had a previous one. just started a month ago.","i believe was completely designed and built by . crazy, talented people..","you started using redux?","this lets you easily just dump a bunch of apps in a directory and go i'm going to be using this all over the place...","yes. i believe we still have sooo far to go when it comes to ui design","sure, could do that as well. just following the lead of react core \\_()_/","think about it like react-addons. you wouldn't just name something that if you weren't official.","just like react core, i'm sure polymer core has to try and sell people on using their tech internally.","i think some of 's talk was probably directed at google internally.","e.g. when the condition is falsy, your <if> component just discards this.props.children, which could potentially be large","the problem is that when the condition is falsy, you're just building up a bunch of vdom elements and throwing them away","yep, i've built a few components like that in the past. i try to avoid the \"if\" type components nowadays though.","any good links? also, i suppose the nation splitting led to the code splitting discussion?","i'm not! but i know digs it. maybe he'll help lil' old-school <script> tag me to move along","the basic idea behind the experiment was to see if instead of just telling us \"something changed\" redux could tell us \"what changed\"","that's insane. never thought i'd see the day when react was more popular than angular","i put a lot of ternaries inline in my jsx. branches that i don't take don't ever execute.","i know! i've built many apis, done lots and lots of normalizing in my work","when using redux, is it a terrible idea to have a reducer that *always* returns a new object? is that how you nest data?","still, addons-controlled is just a react component. feel free to dig in and work it","i mean, it's a pretty safe bet to use a dep that is so small like addons-routes. v4 is just components","e.g. the definition of \"web page\" changes from site to site. seems like we need a different primitive. maybe it's a bundle.","just to clarify: i'm not talking about putting all my app state in redux. just application lifecycle stuff: boot, load data, session, etc.","i don't mean keep everything in redux. just app lifecycle stuff.","current status: investigating using redux to manage the entire application lifecycle. anyone else doing this?","it's funny though, the react docs are so littered with deprecation warnings these days, it discourages experimentation.","me too. google is working on a new laptop. can't wait to see it.","i blame jsx. it really breaks down in that style of composition.","hey, thanks :) i really appreciate that","in college i was the only kid with a mac. now i wanna be the only dev without one.","i wanna kick my apple habit so bad. just can't find good alternatives.","people ask me all. the. time. how they can better learn javascript and i have no clue where to send them.","i've actually got a different mechanism for each in the redux bindings i've been working on. \"run\" vs \"bind\"","in other words \"it's a javascript thing\"","we're also following the lead of create-react-app in all our material, so instance prop initializers are fair game, thank goodness.","yep. this is one that i learned from the interview with the stripe founders. can't remember if it was john or patrick...","sometimes tech founders have the tendency to want to hide their mistakes. at yc every time you talked to someone they were \"killing it\"","i'd totally agree with that 99% of the time. every once in a while someone gets rich inventing cool tech","that sounds totally obvious but people do it all. the. time. if you can't get anyone genuinely excited about what you're building, just stop","if you're not making $$ (and many tech startups don't) it's easy for minor disagreements to escalate and destroy the company","do you know of any other toolchain that lets you do that? maybe clojurescript?","i miss the days when i got to decide how to write my own code","that's in react too, right?","of course :) i'm honestly not sure what to recommend. have you tried eloquent jacascript?","i should probably just stop writing js too and move to","i think i should embrace this new, dark side of me. michael jackson, bad guy of javascript","yep, that's what i was thinking too. unfortunately the babel parser already forces us to have all imports in the root scope :/","what's the largest file in the npm registry? any guesses?","ya we've already got the node_env checks. i'm wondering if there's a way to exclude the module from the build entirely","does envify remove \"dead imports\" from the build? if you import using es6 modules and then don't use it?","i'm talking about the import, not the actual component.proptypes. how do you tell webpack to not actually import the file?","... and to me it feels very much like stitching together react components. i think we still have a ways to go, but it's a start.","so e.g. i can say \"this config represents an app server. i need 10 of them, and run them all behind this load balancer\"","you can compose an ansible config just like you compose react components, by importing some code and injecting it somewhere.","react component props are your protocol for communicating between systems. like thrift or protobufs are for your backend.","no, i haven't used them enough. but i know docker and kubernetes are very popular.","react components are systems in and of themselves. you can compose them to build larger systems.","linux containers are the react components of the devops world. composable, reproducable, and isolated.","no base classes != no component local state. there are other ways you can get it","i wonder if anyone has written about \"infra fatigue\" yet.

programming in 2016!","oh wait, re-reading through that article it seems 's web_concurrency env var is just an avail memory allocation","at the heart, the app is really simple. grab a tgz from the npm registry and serve the files inside it. done.","we used to be the default in the \"quick add\" section but it looks like they reverted back to cdnjs","i had no idea. and i thought read the entire website on day one. was the site recently updated to show that stuff?","on the one hand i really admire for pushing the limits of the web. on the other, it all just seems totally impractical","i think before react i would've said appendchild was an \"inherently imperative\" operation, like other dom manipulations","e.g. i can imagine a ruby or python dev being annoyed they have to install node to manage deps","this is, ofc, not a technical limitation but something that will likely bother devs in other non-js ecosystems","seems like the major barrier to adoption in other ecosystems would be the fact that yarn requires node to run, right?","i'm not sure i follow. yarn is more than an \"npm i\" replacement? please say more.","absolutely. deleting code is so satisfying.","just imagine if programming were more like golf, and the smallest apis with the fewest number of lines were always the winners.","\"if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as \"lines produced\" but as \"lines spent\"\" another gem!","working with the service worker api sure makes me glad i took time to thoroughly learn and use promises. it's full of them.","i'm saying i have a hunch we can do better than react-redux. provide the same benefits with less indirection. maybe not.","i agree, but i also think it's possible we can find more obvious ways to connect redux to react...","yes, react-redux removes a lot of the boilerplate. but the jump from setstate/state => dispatch/connect is a big one conceptually speaking.","then, after we get a chance to talk about higher-order components and context, introduce connect and <provider>.","i'm thinking it'll be a lot easier to teach redux w/out react-redux. introduce a few concepts at a time, starting with the store + setstate.","i've been playing around with service worker and offline-first apps a lot recently, and 's course is top-notch!","internet rando's are the best. \"hey, have you heard about react?! it's awesome!\"","i was working on the same thing in mootools at the time, and ext.js was an order of magnitude faster by inlining everything.","reminds me of the old ext.js version of what became queryselectorall that compiled queries to a flat function. and it was fast","agree. you either have to be a core dev or talk to them a lot just to know what to write.","good docs are harder than good code sometimes. i've just done readmes for my last few projects.","by my count, has now made very significant contributions to *3* package managers. what a champ!","honestly, i haven't used the new router enough yet to know. it just *feels* like you should only need components.","it's great for demos and other kinds of sites where you don't have/want a build process.","if that's someone's first exposure to react components, it makes it harder for them to understand how powerful they can be imo","yes! i think that's right. putting too much emphasis on components-for-presentation can inhibit understanding, i think.","i've never personally used redux-thunk. always just passed around dispatch and called it whenever i needed to.","what's the best resource for getting started using redux in a real app? asking for a friend.","in other words, if you can write react components you can add the features you need to react router v4.","also, is showing us how it's easier to start contributing to

think i should've been an angular developer.","ya, it's silly. i decided not to use slack bc of stuff like this. now apple is incorporating it into messages :(","is it possible to disable rich url previews in messages conversations in macos sierra? my google-fu is failing me.","even if we were perfect at optimizing \"least number of upset people\", that number will never be 0 :shipit:","alright, guess we'd better ship react router v4 final asap. looks like people are already using our little preview in production.","haha, i remember that too. boston, last nov. i put up an html page right before my flight took off.","i know the redux devs got their ideas from elm, among other places. not sure about om. but they do time travel, etc.","ah, makes sense. redux is the major catalyst for this idea, in my experience. emphasizes \"pure, stateless components\".","ha, i tried doing this as well! :) i wanted all my <script> tags to look like my <meta> tags in my <head>","agree. i'm already compiling w webpack target=node and it's a pain. no fun.","commonjs has that same problem, right?","right now i'm writing es6 modules for front-end code, commonjs on node. it's kind of messy though :/","like, the *theory* sounds nice. we *should* be able to only import pieces of code from modules, etc. but is it practical?","mmm, ya. i think that's kind of what we're after with the <match> component. even has the same name!","ha, i remember undefined args really threw me for a loop going from ruby to js. they're treated differently.","\"separation of concerns\" blinds a lot of us to the brilliance of react. i get that question regularly in workshops.","because javascript doesn't have pattern matching ;) haha, jk. please, say more. what do you mean?","i think that's an incredibly healthy way to live. not to feel bad about it, just to recognize that it happens frequently.","i do the same thing all the time. have to actually write some code before i can see the limitations of things. ;)","ha! i remember a talk where he joked \"nobody cares what they're building as long as they get to use cool tech\"","whenever i see tabs on github i'm like \"man, i can't use this code! screw that guy!\"","so many of us think about optimizing stuff before we have any clue how to measure if it's even slow.","ah, me too. not exaggerating: i get the \"performance in react\" question in every workshop on the 1st day","maybe if well-known programmers talk about times they were wrong, it can help others realize it's ok. we all still have stuff to learn :)","but i had no idea about vdom or any of the other stuff that makes react cool, so took me a while to get that :)","... so i was already prepped. i had felt the pain of writing my own programming language firsthand, and didn't like it.","i'm really not trying to brag, but jsx was the appealing part to me. i had spent the past year rewriting mustache.js","oh snap! you had to dig deep to find that tweet. thanks man :) appreciate it.","ha! join the club. i think just about everyone was wrong about react when they first saw it ;)","haha ;) programming can be such a macho endeavor. highly competitive. i wanna explore the vulnerable side.","wow, i missed that one. huge respect for writing that piece. babel 6 gave me a few wtf moments as well ;)","as programmers, we tend to talk about solutions. we like to show others how smart we are. i'd love to hear about times you *weren't* ;)","as a computer programmer, what are some things that you've been wrong about? was it because of ignorance or unwillingness to learn?","hey, thanks for sharing :) the high-level api could use some polish, but all the pieces for great composition are there, i think","it doesn't look like i can buy a replacement cable for my apple thunderbolt display anywhere. is that correct? how sad :/","hey, you're welcome! :) i'd love to hear if you run into any snags. i think the high-level api can still improve a lot.","in all seriousness: if you're really good at coming up with decisive names, and not changing your mind later, you'd be a great programmer.","in a traditional \"stack\" push means put something on the stack, pop means take something off. not so w browser history stacks","hey, that's compound components! :d nicely done! i like your api. composes well!","ya, go for it. there's lots of stuff in there. in general i don't try to do too much. just the basics. let others build on top."]
