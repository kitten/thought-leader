host that you edited with microsoft frontpage.","all of these javascript fatigue blog posts are giving me fatigue.","it's like the millionth time this argument has happened on twitter","why am i not surprised this turned into an aggro ember vs react debate","just tested `react-native`, cleared `node_modules` and `~/.npm` no progress: 2m47s progress: 3m12s very small diff","`rm -rf ~/.npm` too. you're probably hitting the cache.","confession: i use caps lock to do capital letters instead of using the shift key.","you've also missing the step where they offer a facebook login but then display the same registration form after...","are you arguing that the changes to javascript are unnecessary?","nobody wants a massive hundreds of gigabyte blockchain that will grow exponentially just for package management","would help with tooling interop too as not only package managers consume package.json","stuff like package comments and the `dependencies` allowed to be an array/string","i think package.json should be more formally standardised. while looking through npm behaviour i was surprised by a lot","if it used the npm registry then it's using your servers that you have to pay for and support","but if it used the npm registry then npm inc would effectively have to support it?","if someone wrote an alternative npm client that gained significant popularity how would npm inc respond?","the question is do you think a package manager can compete with npm given npm's elevated status in node core?","i think its a big thing stopping other clients. bower and jspm always get flack for having to install them with npm","it's impossible to avoid lock-in when you're the package manager included with node. it's an unfair playing field.","93. reenact js drama threads as a puppet show 94. belly flop contest 95. slide down transamerica pyramid","promoting a code of conduct while being patronising to \"kids\" does not seem fair","i just want to write code that works, not

javascript","i only wrote babeljs so i could get mad twitter followers and retweets","74. three legged race where the other person is an angry dev who's pr you rejected 75. who can take the most ubers

removed in babel 6 because it's not in the spec","cc this is ridiculous. this has got to be an npm violation of some kind.","no, google hangouts, get it right mate","the cut off on signatures in the readme vs the google doc is extremely bizarre","the worst is when i saw a conf with the tagline \"js for everyone\" or something like that and all the speakers were dudes...","aka a single line of config and an install command. $ npm install babel-preset-s2015 $ echo '{ \"presets\": [\"es2015\"] }' >.babelrc","employee in rome was vaping while serving food. i don't know how to feel about this.","they directly use the babel api. electron/atom for example has the babel directive and have special options","and figure out some way to autoupdate integrations through a script or by moving them into the monorepo","well have to figure out some way to coordinate with the projects that expose babel to match their rel. cycle","there's also projects who directly expose babel and depend on it

your happiness from this pic","imagine a js podcast hosted by gucci mane","i started off doing that but then i remembered that i'm australian and we don't care","if you use package.json then you lose the ability to migrate slowly which is important imo","can we not just have an extension? .module.js? package.json seems flaky.","how are you so poor that you can't even afford a chair wtf you work for google","@gabagabadev i care very little about new syntax","babel readme is short with big headings, contributing.md had big text telling saying not to open issues for support. doesn't help.","no idea, probably not. i'm pretty happy being limited to a useful subset.","the day i don't have to use babel in node can't come any sooner","tubes are clogged. need to rehydrate the npm cache.","i doubt anybody who goes on about this tool fatigue bullshit actually practices what they preach","all of these services (bar imessage) have a web client. you could totally just load them up in a sandbox and read their dom...","i use too many chat apps and it's doing my head in. fb messenger, whatsapp, telegram, slack, skype, irc, google hangouts, imessage...","babel is a javascript compiler. the entire

etc.","it strikes me as a pointless term when you can just use dce which is more descriptive","the term tree shaking is silly. it's the same as using transpiler instead of compiler","it's a pretty internal package and isn't really suitable for public consumption yet.","erm, why do you think it's secretive? it's just an internal module that turns an ast into code.","i hope mine didn't appear like that :(","you could easily have a babel plugin do it","a package.json and then makes sure it's in your declared dependencies.","so sad that github doesn't have a way to archive repos. resorting to hacks like these is disappointing","not unless you bug someone who works at npm :( might be able to help for one off cases","it's 4pm but it's dark outside what is happening i am so confused. i can't handle this.","uglify dead code elimination isn't very smart","not sure, end of feb maybe for react conf","also australia isn't one of the approved countries for global access so double :(","yeah, exactly. static analysability of es2015 modules over commonjs is waaaay overblown imo","idk why people say this. commonjs modules can be easily statically analysed too if that's your goal."]
