hello london reactors!",":( not sure. have you been using the same device for testing and have the browser in a weird state?","graphql is generally load a url w/ params, get json back. any networking client lib will get you started.","probably not in the initial release of the spec, no. but specific client libs aren't required to get started.","either we have to limit what you can put in the collections, or we have to accept that some items might be mutable js objects","the collections are generic and can contain anything. other immutable values, or any javascript object.","i always 1.5x or 2x my podcasts, so i'll just listen to jafarcast at normal speed and be happy","i love to see public api and libraries coming together. i'd love to show you self-doc'ing apis i'm building. may be helpful!","they use react native for parts, it's unlikely they will ever be 100% react-native","our ios and android apps are also powered by graphql :)","there are way more clients than servers, not all servers are js and may not desire a json based ast. string is reliable form.","we will have a standardized js parser, but parsing is a responsibility of the server, not the client","nice list! we have so many great tools these days","already some great transducer libs out there that work out of the box with immutable.js!","not sure why so negative. maybe because we haven't finalized api so over-abundance of caution.","trying to improve the api with lessons learned from xhp before including in docs.","not sure :(. the library is 10 years old now and to be honest i mostly forget how it works.","your work at was enviable - can't wait to see your next generation of tools.","my preso from react conf earlier this year - perf of native array to persistent vector.","an even shittier way to view the penalty is the u.s. tax code supports wives as non-professional property of husbands. not great.","feel free to copy where appropriate!","very good! should also add \"displayname\" in there somewhere so your debug tools still work.","why is there an un-removable apple watch app on my home screen, apple? i don't own one and those that do could download from the app store.","we use the same tools for ios and android, obv different client side data structures, but same toolchain","hopefully graphql will be the right interop tool for this, it's lang agnostic, just have some \"map and vector\" types","sometimes when i'm feeling a bit evil, i accept or decline a meeting from my mobile device.","yeah - not happening for all people, so maybe a dirty dns server somewhere. also clear related browser cache","so weird that that's happening for everyone and not me looking into dns settings","this looks like fun! beautiful structure. does yours animate through the avalanches? code posted anywhere?","whole article is on point. i hope #3 happens much faster than 2020","pretty well received, excitement from the room, but there's still a lot of work to be done for them to feel js native.","pulled an all-nighter my last night in paris to merge and release a bunch of prs on . v3.7.0 now live on npm. <3 mon amour.","unfortunately apple still only lets you build ios apps from a mac, so yes - some hardware required.","the syntax is typescript notation (and flow notation) explaining argument and return types","every app platform/framework has to start with farts. get it out of your system, it's all natural.","we've used a similar utility at facebook since 2010. querythenmutatedom(queryfn, mutatefn). super useful!","also, your react example loses many of its benefits by full build on changes. perhaps better is to have change trigger re-render.","looks interesting! fbk: does too much. might be better as two libs: this v interesting pub/sub api, separate lib for view rendering","probably is the speed of typescript, i'm not sure about how to speed that up, but open to suggestions.","happy to take initial prs in contrib until then though!","use all tools. make shit work.","@vjbambhaniya sort of. stores are simply keeping data as state in the top component. actions is passing fns down as props.","there's often immutable.js chatter in on freenode","in react v0.13 (currently beta) you won't need to do this anymore","subtle distinction happening here. for memoization === is ok. \"is this definitely not the same\".","so agree for static content. we moved to native at fb because of creation/editing ui woes and crashes due to animation and gestures.","actionscript was still one of my favorite languages to use, despite its flaws.","really great write up! i was waiting for someone to cover bridging back to native.","no. just keeping api simple. feel free to pr your suggestions though.","with the current impl, no. you can't do that. i'm hoping others implement better cursor libraries! tradeoffs to every approach.","agreed. i'm a big fan of having more tools, not less :)","js uses references, as do most \"pointerless\" langs. structural sharing results in very small memory overhead.","a lot of this bears repeating! i haven't decided on a talk for react-eu yet. prob related but different.","not sure what you're asking. maybe move to github issues for >140c convo? cursors are values, just like other immutable objs","we're using react state for those things. relay's store is a structured cache of server data. can still have ext state store","told you this would suck you back in to game dev :)","i cut my programming teeth on hypercard, 25yr ago.","the ref is making is to a re-arch of ios news feed we did last year. same concepts, but not reactjs","flux for c. plain ol' js objects and arrays for m (or immutable.js if you're up for it).","mobile has many platforms: ios, android, winmo, web. web still holds a huge % of the pie, worldwide. not likely to change.","our community use many platforms and we care deeply about quality of every single one. react native = dev efficiency = quality.","we work closely with every browser vendor, and are on tc39. we push on web quality hard.","a plurality of our community still need quality mobile web. we care about mobile web quality quite a lot.","if you mean stateful mutation or side-effects, then correct within render method - must be pure. otherwise react has no opinion.","iow models are just data? if i can't use objects and arrays with your view library, it's not flexible enough.","of course, if an application changes over time, mutation must exist somewhere. the q is where. react pushes mutation to fringe.","react reconciliation diffs new and old immutable representation of ui, produces imperative mutative change-set to apply to dom","core idea of react is a pure render function that takes in data, and returns an immutable *representation* of ui.","delivered a great talk on how react.js was flexible enough to solve problems while integrating into their codebase.","will teach you angular using a learning tool they built with react. so good.","correct! that was the first diff to land after 0.12.2 was cut. anything iterable can be children: array or immutable.js","ohhh. ordered map but you're converting to js object at the end. js object orders num keys specially.","memory leak would be a bug. afaik no bug of this kind in immutable.js or mori/clojurescript","yes the point is we're not stuck with just one! we can use plain ones or complex ones or custom ones. react doesn't care","i want you to use immutable data in every environment, not just js","potentially. rest is usually just glue between uris and the soup of your application server. graphql fills that same role","graphql was built for our ios app in 2012. relay came much later to bring a js api","sweet! i didn't even know that was doc'd. very happy it is","\"codegen from server type system\" i talked about at last night was graphql","no, but there's tons of non-facebook blog posts on how to do server rendering. ours looks very similar","react's most powerful feature is now the virtual uikit","i'm hoping to see more ios engineers learn about react. thanks !","having issues?
