render","neither seems good children are implementation detail why would you want to modify them breaks isolation","that said react itself works with the dom so it cant possibly be faster than equivalent dom mutations written by hand","see some perf patterns are bad with dom and definitely i wouldnt suggest using it for logic","so it only does this during mounting during updates existing objects are updated with new props","it creates an internal object for each component including platform-specific like div they are retained tho","maybe can answer i always wondered myself","react just keeps objects around which have current props on them thats about it it doesnt recreate trees of them","theres no full vdom thats the problem this is a misunderstanding of how react works it doesnt create vdom trees","thats internals im referring to the api design","early on it was important to emphasize were not actually replacing all html on every single render","at this point similar architectures are mainstream so its hurting more than helping at this point","im not sure who came up with the term but it definitely helped early adoption of react as the whole idea was too new","yea this is why i really dont like this term people have all sorts of wrong mental model about it","im personally not a fan of wrapping js data structures into ones provided by a library prefer to have control","our goal is to make reconciliation run in chunks in idle time but make commit phase thin so it doesnt miss a frame","yes","again the point of react isnt being fast its diving ui in declarative components it only helps if browser is fast","reconciliation takes longer than commit thats exactly why were making reconciliation pausable in fiber","so no applying dom changes is usually pretty fast although of course it can trigger layouts and paints","all of the above is reconciliation we call applying dom changes a commit and its done in a single pass in fiber","the more expensive part is calling react components recursively to learn which elements they render to and diffing child lists","this is not expensive its just reassignment also not fair to call it update were just keeping the props around","what do you mean by vdom is updated in react all that happens is internalinstanceprops newelementprops","whats the point of updating it not sure im following","if you need to kick off a request etc use didupdate","if you know result synchronously then you dont need to keep it in state at all just calculate in render","this is why vdom is not really helping the discussion i dont even know when people say this term","so can reconciling too many layers of react components on every update","updating or reading from dom nodes unnecessarily and in a bad order eg write then read can be bad for perf","not really i dont like the vdom term because it makes everything very fuzzy and seem more magic than it really is","myth react is faster than dom reality it helps create maintainable applications and is fast enough for most","using local state is absolutely fine if it was bad then it would not exist in react","thats up to you really could use lifecycle methods or could separate that","sure youll bump the version number of react-scripts as usual and follow instructions in changelog","that said whatever works for you is great and i know some people prefer to use redux this way","if it works well for you then cool but thats not really how i intended redux to be used see faq","the point of reducers is a multiple reducers can handle the same action in different ways b they specify how state evolves","imo defeats the point of reducers once you do that you might as well operate on immutable value directly","you can return just the parts that changed react merges it into the state itself","this is just the way stream works please check back later when videos are published will take a few days i expect","its okay-ish although id probably memoize sepately","yes deriving state from props should usually be avoided because its hard to keep them in sync","was lucky enough to see them in london beautiful show","its okay but prevents any components below including nested from preserving local state","yea i guess we need that section back the solution is to use props for this","its a good thing to write about","please read it described this exact problem and the right solution to it","if you just want it for setstate you should instead provide thispropsonchange and call that","what is the point of this code seems very contrived why not use instead of trying to sync it","there is no mutation reassigning a variable reference is not mutation","i wrote a fixed version here i agree verbosity is annoying and well be fixing that in future version","state based on props is not as common eg changing button color shouldnt untoggle the button","instances are not destroyed when next props are received this is intentional in most cases you want to preserve state","right generally this is a pattern to avoid state derived from props if you really need it use componentwillreceiveprops","what do you mean react doesnt recycle instances or anything like this mind filing an issue to discuss","for example you may not be aware that you can include this plugin in dev for better warnings","try ityou may still pick up a few new tricks","depends on what you knew before everyones background is different","not sure what you mean","data flow is described in the docs do you know if getting people to read it helps","im not sure how far this can be linted but worth discussing","maybe worth enforcing some convention eg state should be called initial if its derived from props unless you also have cwrp","its not really much two or three things we should add to the docs","if props change your state goes stale if you really really need it think twice then componentwillreceiveprops is your friend","a lotpeople usually have an intuition that its better to cache or give names to everything","this looks like a good proposal want to file an issue in eslint-plugin-react","or just moving the function call to render -","probably looked there but just in case","i dont really see the value in adding a library where removing some code will do for other use cases sure -","operator mono","or just not caching what doesnt need to be cached","oh and finally the whole example is bad because you cant just concatenate first and last name to get a full name","we could also make it shorter while were at it","heres the good one dont try to cache things in the state derive from props in render if you can","hint this fixes the bug but its still bad","this react example is bad and buggy can you see why","lots of snarky people on twitter

fact that people writing react apps often arent educated enough about code splitting","afaik the people youre talking about agreed that its not reacts startup cost thats prohibitive","youre the ones

people to build very ambitious uis but technical and educational advance in bundling is not quite there yet","interesting thread a bit more nuanced than such threads usually turn out to be","if its an educational issue we could have a page explaining how to load components dynamically","which part is inappropriate lack of high level forcing function to bundle less and split more","this way of

some point","handled","yea but again usually it doesnt matter","seems like fragile coupling why not do this on react level instead","in most practical cases this doesnt matter in perf critical code

anything","hopefully","you can enable break on caught exceptions in debugger and then look at call stack for catches","thats where the error is likely being swallowed maybe you have catch for error handling or similar","this is not where the problem is look for whats causing rerender like setstate or redux dispatch","one common case in which it happens is when people use catch for promise and

review","which one","the solution is to declare libraries as externals and include vendor files separately this makes reviewers job much easier","update one of the reasons for delayed review is a
